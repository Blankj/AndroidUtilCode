.SH "NAME"
\fBnpm-shrinkwrap.json\fR \- A publishable lockfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBnpm\-shrinkwrap\.json\fP is a file created by npm help shrinkwrap\. It is identical to
\fBpackage\-lock\.json\fP, with one major caveat: Unlike \fBpackage\-lock\.json\fP,
\fBnpm\-shrinkwrap\.json\fP may be included when publishing a package\.
.P
The recommended use\-case for \fBnpm\-shrinkwrap\.json\fP is applications deployed
through the publishing process on the registry: for example, daemons and
command\-line tools intended as global installs or \fBdevDependencies\fP\|\. It's
strongly discouraged for library authors to publish this file, since that would
prevent end users from having control over transitive dependency updates\.
.P
Additionally, if both \fBpackage\-lock\.json\fP and \fBnpm\-shrinkwrap\.json\fP are present
in a package root, \fBpackage\-lock\.json\fP will be ignored in favor of this file\.
.P
For full details and description of the \fBnpm\-shrinkwrap\.json\fP file format, refer
to the manual page for npm help 5 package\-lock\.json\.
