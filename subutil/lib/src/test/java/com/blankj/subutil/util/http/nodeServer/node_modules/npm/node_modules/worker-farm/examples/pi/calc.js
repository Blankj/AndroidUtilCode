/* A simple Ï€ estimation function using a Monte Carlo method
 * For 0 to `points`, take 2 random numbers < 1, square and add them to
 * find the area under that point in a 1x1 square. If that area is <= 1
 * then it's *within* a quarter-circle, otherwise it's outside.
 * Take the number of points <= 1 and multiply it by 4 and you have an
 * estimate!
 * Do this across multiple processes and average the results to
 * increase accuracy.
