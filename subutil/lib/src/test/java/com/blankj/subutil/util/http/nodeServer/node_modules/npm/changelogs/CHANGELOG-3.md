### v3.10.10 (2016-11-04)

See the discussion on [#14042](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/14042) for
more context on this release, which is intended to address a serious regression
in shrinkwrap behavior in the version of the CLI currently bundled with Node.js
6 LTS "Boron". You should never install this version directly; instead update
to `npm@4`, which has everything in this release and more.

#### REGRESSION FIX

* [`9aebe98`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/9aebe982114ea2107f46baa1dcb11713b4aaad04)
  [#14117](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/14117)
  Fixes a bug where installing a shrinkwrapped package would fail if the
  platform failed to install an optional dependency included in the shrinkwrap.

#### UPDATE SUPPORT MATRIX

With the advent of the second official Node.js LTS release, Node 6.x
'Boron', the Node.js project has now officially dropped versions 0.10
and 0.12 out of the maintenance phase of LTS. (Also, Node 5 was never
part of LTS, and will see no further support now that Node 7 has been
released.) As a small team with limited resources, the npm CLI team is
following suit and dropping those versions of Node from its CI test
matrix.

  [#14503](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/14503)
  Node 6 is LTS; 5.x, 0.10, and 0.12 are unsupported.

### v3.10.9 (2016-10-06)

Hi everyone! This is the last of our monthly releases. We're going to give
an every-two-weeks schedule a try starting with our next release. We'll
reevaluate in a quarter, but we suspect that will be what we'll stick with.
You might be wondering _why_ we've been fiddling with the release cadence? Well,
we've been trying to tune it to to minimize the overhead for our little team.

This is ALSO the ULTIMATE release of `npm` version 3. That's right, in
just two weeks' time (October 20th for you fans of calendar time), our dear
`npm` will be hitting the big 4.0.

**DON'T PANIC**

This is gonna be a much, MUCH smaller major version than 3.x was. Maybe even
smaller than 2.x was. I can't tell you everything that'll be in there just
yet, but at the very least it's going to have what's in our
[4.x milestone](https://github.com/npm/npm/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+milestone%3A4.x),
PLUS, the first steps in 
[making `prepublish` work](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10074) the way
people expect it to.

**NOW ABOUT THIS RELEASE**

This release sees a whole slew of bug fixes. Notably a bunch of lifecycle
fixes and a really important shrinkwrap fix.

#### LIFECYCLE FIXES

* [`d388f90`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/d388f90732981633b3cdb4fc7fb0fababd4e64ab)
  [#13942](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13942)
  Fix current working directory while running shrinkwrap lifecycle scripts.
  Previously if you ran a shrinkwrap from another lifecycle script AND
  `node_modules` existed (and if you're running `npm shrinkwrap` it probably
  should) then `npm` would run the shrinkwrap lifecycle from the
  `node_modules` folder instead of the package folder.

  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))
* [`c3b6cdf`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/c3b6cdfedcdb4d9e7712be5245d9b274828d88d1)
  [#13964](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13964)
  Fix bug where the `uninstall` lifecycles weren't being run when you
  reinstalled/updated an existing module.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))
* [`72bb89c`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/72bb89c1aa9811a18cbd766f3da73da76eb920c6)
  [#13344](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13344)
  When running lifecycles use `TMPDIR` if it's writable and fall back to the
  current working directory if not. Previously we just assumed `TMPDIR`
  wouldn't be writable (as we might have been running as `nobody` and
  `nobody` on some systems can't write to `TMPDIR`).
  ([@aaronjensen](https://github.com/aaronjensen))

#### SHRINKWRAP GIT & TAGGED DEPENDENCY FIX

* [`3b5eee0`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/3b5eee0d31737d1c2518ed95dcc7aaaaa93c253c)
  [#13941](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13941)
  Fix git and tagged dependency matching with shrinkwraps.  Previously git
  and tag (ie `foo@latest`) dependencies installed from a shrinkwrap would
  always be flagged as invalid.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### BUG FIXES

* [`bf3bd1e`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/bf3bd1e4347ee2c5de08d23558c4444749178c8b)
  [#14143](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/14143)
  Fix bug in `npm version` where `npm-shrinkwrap.json` wouldn't be updated
  if you ran `npm version` from outside of your project root.
  ([@lholmquist](https://github.com/lholmquist))
* [`1089878`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/1089878f58977559414c8a9addfc69a9c68905b0)
  [#13613](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13613)
  Log 'skipping action' as 'verbose' instead of 'warn'. This removes a lot of
  clutter when there are links in your `node_modules`. The long term plan is
  to entirely blind `npm` to what's inside links, which will make this code
  go away entirely.
  ([@timoxley](https://github.com/timoxley))
* [`952f1e1`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/952f1e109a070ab4066179f6104ba9394300e342)
  [#13999](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13999)
  Fix a bug where setting `bin` to `null` in your `package.json` would result
  in `npm` crashing.
  ([@IonicaBizau](https://github.com/IonicaBizau))
* [`fcf8b11`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/fcf8b11fb7fcf8902f6a887c3d5f0aef2897dde0)
  [#14032](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/14032)
  When using `npm view`, if you specified a version that didn't exist it
  would previously print `undefined` (even if you asked for JSON output). It
  now prints nothing in this situation. This brings `npm@3`'s behavior in
  line with `npm@2`.
  ([@roblg](https://github.com/roblg))
* [`93c689f`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/93c689ff44c6042a2dcde7fe0d74d2264237d666)
  [#14032](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/14032)
  When using `npm view --json` with a version range that matches multiple
  versions we now return a list of all of the metadata for all of those
  versions. Previously we picked one and only returned that. This brings
  `npm@3`'s behavior in line with `npm@2`.
  ([@roblg](https://github.com/roblg))
* [`2411728`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/24117289e09c373b845150c45e4793d98fe7cf4b)
  [#14045](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/14045)
  Fix a Windows-only bug in the `git` tests. The tests had rather particular
  ideas about what arguments would be passed to `git` and on Windows they
  got this wrong.

### v3.10.8 (2016-09-08)

Monthly releases are so big! Just look at all this stuff!

Our quarter of monthly releases is almost over. The next one, in October, might
very well be our last one as we move to trying something different and learning
lessons from our little experiment.

You may also want to keep an eye our for `npm@4` next month, since we're
planning on finally releasing it then and including a (small) number of breaking
changes we've been meaning to do for a long time. Don't worry, though: `npm@3`
will still be around for a bit and will keep getting better and better, and is
most likely going to be the version that `node@6` uses once it goes to LTS.

As some of us have mentioned before, npm is likely to start doing more regular
semver-major bumps, while keeping those bumps significantly smaller than the
huge effort that was `npm@3` -- we're not very likely to do a world-shaking
thing like that for a while, if ever.

All that said, let's move on to the patches included in v3.10.8!

#### SHRINKWRAP LEVEL UP

The most notable part of this release is a series of commits meant to make `npm
shrinkwrap` more consistent. By itself, shrinkwrap seems like a fairly
straightforward thing to implement, but things get complicated when it starts
interacting with `devDependencies`, `optionalDependencies`, and
`bundledDependencies`. These commits address some corner cases related to these.

* [`a7eca32`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/a7eca3246fbbcbb05434cb6677f65d14c945d74f)
  [#10073](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10073)
  Record if a dependency is only used as a devDependency and exclude it from the
  shrinkwrap file.
  ([@bengl](https://github.com/bengl))
* [`1eabcd1`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/1eabcd16bf2590364ca20831096350073539bf3a)
  [#10073](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10073)
  Record if a dependency is optional to shrinkwrap.
  ([@bengl](https://github.com/bengl))
* [`03efc89`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/03efc89522c99ee0fa37d8f4a99bc3b44255ef98)
  [#13692](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13692/)
  We were doing a weird thing where we used a `package.json` field `installable`
  to check to see if we'd checked for platform compatibility, and if not did
  so. But this was the only place that was ever done so there was no reason to
  implement it in such an obfuscated manner.
  Instead it now just directly checks and then records that its done so on the
  node object with `knownInstallable`. This is useful to know because modules
  expanded via shrinkwrap don't go through this– `inflateShrinkwrap` does not
  currently have any rollback semantics and so checking this sort of thing there
  is unhelpful.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))
* [`ff87938`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/ff879382fda21dac7216a5f666287b3a7e74a947)
  [#11735](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/11735)
  Running `npm install --save-dev` will now update shrinkwrap file, but only
  if there already are devDependencies in it.
  ([@szimek](https://github.com/szimek))
* [`c00ca3a`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/c00ca3aef836709eeaeade91c5305bc2fbda2e8a)
  [#13394](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/13394)
  Check installability of modules from shrinkwrap, since modules that came into
  the tree vie shrinkwrap won't already have this information recorded in
  advance.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### INSTALLER ERROR REPORTING LEVEL UP

As part of the shrinkwrap push, there were also a lot of error-reporting
improvements. Some to add more detail to error objects, others to fix bugs and
inconsistencies.

* [`2cdd713`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/2cdd7132abddcc7f826a355c14348ce9a5897ffe)
  Consistently set code on `ETARGET` when fetching package metadata if no
  compatible version is found.

  Include installer warning details at the `verbose` log level.

  Improve various bits of error reporting, adding more error information and
  some related refactoring.

#### MISCELLANEOUS BUGS LEVEL UP

* [`116b6c6`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/116b6c60a174ea0cc49e4d62717e4e26175b6534)
  [#13456](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/13456)
  In lifecycle scripts, any `node_modules/.bin` existing in the hierarchy
  should be turned into an entry in the PATH environment variable.
  However, prior to this commit, it was splitting based on the string
  `node_modules`, rather than restricting it to only path portions like
  `/node_modules/` or `\node_modules\`. So, a path containing an entry
  like `my_node_modules` would be improperly split.

### v3.10.7 (2016-08-11)

Hi all, today's our first release coming out of the new monthly release
cadence. See below for details. We're all recovered from conferences now
and raring to go! We've got some pretty keen bug fixes and a bunch of
documentation and dependency updates. It's hard to narrow it down to just a
few, but of note are scoped packages in bundled dependencies, the
`preinstall` lifecycle fix, the shrinkwrap and Git dependencies fix and the
fix to a crasher involving cycles in development dependencies.

#### NEW RELEASE CADENCE

Releasing npm has been, for the most part, a very prominent part of our
weekly process process. As part of our efforts to find the most effective
ways to allocate our team's resources, we decided last month that we would
try and slow our releases down to a monthly cadence, and see if we found
ourselves with as much extra time and attention as we expected to have.
Process experiments are useful for finding more effective ways to do our
work, and we're at least going to keep doing this for a whole quarter, and
then measure how well it worked out. It's entirely likely that we'll switch
back to a more frequent cadence, specially if we find that the value that
weekly cadence was providing the community is not worth sacrificing for a
bit of extra time. Does this affect you significantly? Let us know!

#### SCOPED PACKAGES IN BUNDLED DEPENDENCIES

Prior to this release and
[v2.15.10](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/v2.15.10), npm had ignored
scoped modules found in `bundleDependencies`.

  Run top level preinstall before installing dependencies
  ([@palmerj3](https://github.com/palmerj3))

#### BETTER SHRINKWRAP WITH GIT DEPENDENCIES

* [`0f7e319`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/0f7e3197bcec7a328b603efdffd3681bbc40f585)
  [#12718](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12718.)
  Update outdated git dependencies found in shrinkwraps. Previously, if the
  module version was the same then no update would be completed even if the
  committish had changed.

#### CYCLES IN DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCIES NO LONGER CRASH

* [`1619871`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/1619871ac0cc8839dc9962c78e736095976c1eb4)
  [#12893](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/12893)
  Only warn about symlink update if version number differs
  The update-linked action outputs a warning that it needs to update the
  linked package, but can't, There is no need for the package to be updated if
  it is already at the correct version.  This change does a check before
  logging the warning.

  [#13581](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/13581)
  The `login` command has long been an alias for `adduser`.
  At the same time, there is an expectation not just of that
  particular word being something to look for, but of there being
  clear symmetry with `logout`.
  So it was a bit confusing when `login` didn't show up in
  `npm help` on a technicality. This seems like an acceptable
  exception to the rule that says "no aliases in `npm help`".

### v3.10.6 (2016-07-07)

This week we have a bunch of bug fixes for ya!  A shrinkwrap regression
introduced in 3.10.0, better lifecycle `PATH` behavior, improvements when
working with registries other than `registry.npmjs.org` and a fix for
hopefully the last _don't print a progress bar over my interactive thingy_
bug.

#### SHRINKWRAP AND DEV DEPENDENCIES

The rewrite in 3.10.0 triggered a bug where dependencies of devDependencies
would be included in your shrinkwrap even if you didn't request
devDependencies.

* [`2484529`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/2484529ab56a42e5d6f13c48006f39a596d9e327)

  Fix bug where deps of devDependencies would be incorrectly included in
  shrinkwraps.

#### BETTER PATH LIFECYCLE BEHAVIOR

hopefully this will bring is to where we want to be.

  [#10869](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10869)
  If the registry returns a list of versions some of which are invalid, skip
  those when picking a version to install.  This can't happen with
  registry.npmjs.org as it will normalize versions published with it, but it
  can happen with other registries.

### v3.10.4 (2016-06-30)

Hey y'all! This release includes a bunch of fixes we've been working on as we
continue on our `big-bug` push. There's still [a lot of it left to
do](https://github.com/npm/npm/labels/big-bug), but once this is done, things
should just generally be more stable, installs should be more reliable and
correct, and we'll be able to move on to more future work. We'll keep doing our
best! 🙌

#### RACES AS WACKY AS [REDLINE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redline_\(2009_film\))

Races are notoriously hard to squash, and tend to be some of the more common
recurring bugs we see on the CLI. [@julianduque](https://github.com/julianduque)
did some pretty awesome [sleuthing
work](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12669) to track down a cache race and
helpfully submitted a patch. There were some related races in the same area that
also got fixed at around the same time, mostly affecting Windows users.

* [`2a37c97`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/2a37c97121483db2b6f817fe85c2a5a77b76080e)
  [#12669](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12669)
  [#13023](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13023)
  The CLI is pretty aggressive about correcting permissions across the cache
  whenever it writes to it. This aggressiveness caused a couple of races where
  temporary cache files would get picked up by `fs.readdir`, and removed before
  `chownr` was called on them, causing `ENOENT` errors. While the solution might
  seem a bit hamfisted, it's actually perfectly safe and appropriate in this
  case to just ignore those resulting `ENOENT` errors.
  ([@julianduque](https://github.com/julianduque))
* [`ea018b9`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/ea018b9e3856d1798d199ae3ebce4ed07eea511b)
  [#13023](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13023)
  If a user were to have SUDO_UID and SUDO_GID, they'd be able to get into a
  pretty weird state. This fixes that corner case.
  ([@zkat](https://github.com/zkat))
* [`703ca3a`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/703ca3abbf4f1cb4dff08be32acd2142d5493482)
  [#13023](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13023)
  A missing `return` was causing `chownr` to be called on Windows, even though
  that's literally pointless, and causing crashes in the process, instead of
  short-circuiting. This was entirely dependent on which callback happened to be
  called first, and in some cases, the failing one would win the race. This
  should prevent this from happening in the future.

#### SHRINKWRAP IS COMPLICATED BUT IT'S BETTER NOW

[@iarna](https://github.com/iarna) did some heroic hacking to refactor a bunch
of `shrinkwrap`-related bits and fixed some resolution and pathing issues that
were biting users. The code around that stuff got more readable/maintainable in
the process, too!

* [`346bba1`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/346bba1e1fee9cc814b07c56f598a73be5c21686)
  [#13214](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13214)

  [#13213](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13213)
  If you run `npm install modulename` it should, if a `npm-shrinkwrap.json` is
  present, use the version found there.  If not, it'll use the version found in
  your `package.json`, and failing *that*, use `latest`.
  This fixes a case where the first check was being bypassed because version
  resolution was being done prior to loading the shrinkwrap, and so checks to
  match the shrinkwrap version couldn't succeed.

### v3.10.3 (2016-06-23)

Given that we had not one, but two updates to our RC this past week, it
should come as no surprise that this week's full release is a bit
lighter. We have some documentation patches and a couple of bug fixes via
dependency updates.

If you haven't yet checked out last week's release,
[v3.10.0](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.10.0)
and the two follow up releases
[v3.10.1](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.10.1)
and
[v3.10.2](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.10.2),
you really should do so. They're the most important releases we've had in
quite a while, fixing a bunch of critical bugs (including an issue
impacting publishing with Node.js 6.x) and of course, bringing in the new
and improved progress bar.

#### BUM SYMLINKS BURN NO MORE

There's been a bug lurking where broken symlinks in your `node_modules`
folder could cause all manner of mischief, from crashes to empty `npm ls`
results. The intrepid [@watilde](https://github.com/watilde) tracked this
down for us.

This addresses the root cause of the outdated crasher we protected
against earlier this week in
[#13115](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/13115).

This also fixes [#9564](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9564), the
problem where a bad symlink in your global modules would result in an
empty result when you ran `npm ls -g`.

This ALSO likely fixes numerous "Missing argument #1" errors. (But surely
not all of them as that's actually just a generic arity and
type-validation failure.)

### v3.10.2 (2016-06-17):

This is a quick hotfix release with two small bug fixes.  First, there was
an issue where the new progress bar would overwrite interactive prompts,
that is, those found in `npm login` and `npm init`.  Second, if the
directory you were running `npm outdated` on was a bad link or otherwise had
unrecoverable errors then npm would crash instead of printing the error.

### v3.10.1 (2016-06-17):

There are two very important bug fixes and one long-awaited (and significant!)
deprecation in this hotfix release. [Hold on.](http://butt.holdings/)

#### *WHOA*

When Node.js 6.0.0 was released, the CLI team noticed an alarming upsurge in
bugs related to important files (like `README.md`) not being included in
published packages. The new bugs looked much like
[#5082](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5082), which had been around in one
form or another since April, 2014. #5082 used to be a very rare (and obnoxious)
bug that the CLI team hadn't had much luck reproducing, and we'd basically
marked it down as a race condition that arose on machines using slow and / or
rotating-media-based hard drives.

Under 6.0.0, the behavior was reliable enough to be nearly deterministic, and
made it very difficult for publishers using `.npmignore` files in combination
with `"files"` stanzas in `package.json` to get their packages onto the
registry without one or more files missing from the packed tarball. The entire
saga is contained within [the issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5082),
but the summary is that an improvement to the performance of
[`fs.realpath()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_realpath_path_options_callback)
made it much more likely that the packing code would lose the race.

Fixing this has proven to be very difficult, in part because the code used by
npm to produce package tarballs is more complicated than, strictly speaking, it
needs to be. [**@evanlucas**](https://github.com/evanlucas) contributed [a
patch](https://github.com/npm/fstream/pull/50) that passed the tests in a
[special test suite](https://github.com/othiym23/eliminate-5082) that I
([**@othiym23**](https://github.com/othiym23)) created (with help from
[**@addaleax**](https://github.com/addaleax)), but only _after_ we'd released
the fixed version of that package did we learn that it actually made the
problem _worse_ in other situations in npm proper. Eventually,
[**@rvagg**](https://github.com/rvagg) put together a more durable fix that
appears to completely address the errant behavior under Node.js 6.0.0. That's
the patch included in this release. Everybody should chip in for redback
insurance for Rod and his family; he's done the community a huge favor.

Does this mean the long (2+ year) saga of #5082 is now over? At this point, I'm
going to quote from my latest summary on the issue:

> The CLI team (mostly me, with input from the rest of the team) has decided that
> the overall complexity of the interaction between `fstream`, `fstream-ignore`,
> `fstream-npm`, and `node-tar` has grown more convoluted than the team is
> comfortable (maybe even capable of) supporting.
>
> - While I believe that @rvagg's (very targeted) fix addresses _this_ issue, I
>   would be shocked if there aren't other race conditions in npm's packing
>   logic. I've already identified a couple other places in the code that are
>   most likely race conditions, even if they're harder to trigger than the
>   current one.
> - The way that dependency bundling is integrated leads to a situation in
>   which a bunch of logic is duplicated between `fstream-npm` and
>   `lib/utils/tar.js` in npm itself, and the way `fstream`'s extension
>   mechanism works makes this difficult to clean up. This caused a nasty
>   regression ([#13088](https://github.com/npm/fstream/pull/50), see below) as
>   of ~`npm@3.8.7` where the dependencies of `bundledDependencies` were no
>   longer being included in the built package tarballs.
> - The interaction between `.npmignore`, `.gitignore`, and `files` is hopelessly
>   complicated, scattered in many places throughout the code. We've been
>   discussing [making the ignores and includes logic clearer and more
>   predictable](https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Files-and-Ignores), and the
>   current code fights our efforts to clean that up.
>
> So, our intention is still to replace `fstream`, `fstream-ignore`, and
> `fstream-npm` with something much simpler and purpose-built. There's no real
> reason to have a stream abstraction here when a simple recursive-descent
> filesystem visitor and a synchronous function that can answer whether a given
> path should be included in the packed tarball would do the job adequately.
>
> What's not yet clear is whether we'll need to replace `node-tar` in the
> process. `node-tar` is a very robust implementation of tar (it handles, like,
> everything), and it also includes some very important tweaks to prevent several
> classes of security exploits involving maliciously crafted packages. However,
> its packing API involves passing in an `fstream` instance, so we'd either need
> to produce something that follows enough of `fstream`'s contract for `node-tar`
> to keep working, or swap `node-tar` out for something like `tar-stream` (and
> then ensuring that our use of `tar-stream` is secure, which could involve
> security patches for either npm or `tar-stream`).

The testing and review of `fstream@1.0.10` that the team has done leads us to
believe that this bug is fixed, but I'm feeling more than a little paranoid
about fstream now, so it's important that people keep a close eye on their
publishes for a while and let us know immediately if they notice any
irregularities.

  ([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23))

#### *ERK*

Because the interaction between `fstream`, `fstream-ignore`, `fsream-npm`, and
`node-tar` is so complex, it's proven difficult to add support for npm features
like `bundledDependencies` without duplicating some logic within npm's code
base. While [fixing a completely unrelated
bug](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9642), we "cleaned up" some of this
seemingly duplicated code, and in the process removed the code that ensured
that the dependencies of `bundledDependencies` are themselves bundled. We've
brought that code back into the code base (without reopening #9642), and added
a test to ensure that this regression can't recur.

#### GOODBYE, FAITHFUL FRIEND

At NodeConf Adventure 2016 (RIP in peace, Mikeal Rogers's NodeConf!), the CLI
team had an opportunity to talk to representatives from some of the larger
companies that we knew were still using Node.js 0.8 in production. After asking
them whether they were still using 0.8, we got back blank stares and questions
like, "0.8? You mean, from four years ago?" After establishing that being able
to run npm in their legacy environments was no longer necessary, the CLI team
made the decision to drop support for 0.8. (Faithful observers of our [team
meetings](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+npm+cli+team+meeting+)
will have known this was the plan for NodeConf since the beginning of 2016.)

In practice, this means only what's in the commit below: we've removed 0.8 from
our continuous integration test matrix below, and will no longer be habitually
testing changes under Node 0.8.  We may also give ourselves permission to use
`setImmediate()` in test code. However, since the project still supports
Node.js 0.10 and 0.12, it's unlikely that patches that rely on ES 2015
functionality will land anytime soon.

Looking forward, the team's current plan is to drop support for Node.js 0.10
when its LTS maintenance window expires in October, 2016, and 0.12 when its
maintenance / LTS window ends at the end of 2016. We will also drop support for
Node.js 5.x when Node.js 6 becomes LTS and Node.js 7 is released, also in the
October-December 2016 timeframe.

(Confused about Node.js's LTS policy? [Don't
be!](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS) If you look at [this
diagram](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS/blob/ce364a94b0e0619eba570cd57be396573e1ef889/schedule.png),
it should make all of the preceding clear.)

If, in practice, this doesn't work with distribution packagers or other
community stakeholders responsible for packaging and distributing Node.js and
npm, please reach out to us. Aligning the npm CLI's LTS policy with Node's
helps everybody minimize the amount of work they need to do, and since all of
our teams are small and very busy, this is somewhere between a necessity and
non-negotiable.

* [`d6afd5f`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/d6afd5ffb1b19e5d94aeee666afcb8adaced58db)
  Remove 0.8 from the Node.js testing matrix, and reorder to match real-world
  priority, with comments. ([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23))

### v3.10.0 (2016-06-16):

Do we have a release for you!  We have our first new lifecycle since
`version`, a new progress bar and a bunch of bug fixes.
[I'm](https://github.com/iarna) really excited about this release, let me
tell you!!

#### DANGER: PUBLISHING ON NODE 6.0.0

Publishing and packing are buggy under Node versions greater than 6.0.0.
Please use Node.js LTS (4.4.x) to publish packages.  See
[#5082](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5082) for details and current
status.

  [#13077](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13077)
  Warn when using Node 6+.
  ([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23))

#### NEW LIFECYCLE SCRIPT: `shrinkwrap`

* [`e8c80f2`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/e8c80f20bfd5d1618e85dbab41660d6f3e5ce405)
  [#10744](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10744)
  You can now add `preshrinkwrap`, `shrinkwrap` and `postshrinkwrap` to your `package.json`
  scripts section. They are run when you run `npm shrinkwrap` or `npm install --save` with
  an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` present in your module directory.

  `preshrinkwrap` and `shrinkwrap` is run prior to generating the new `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
  and `postshrinkwrap` is run after.
  ([@SimenB](https://github.com/SimenB))

#### NEW PROGRESS BAR

![Install with new progress bar](http://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc-images/new-gauge-color.gif)

We have a new progress bar and a bunch of related improvements!

##### BLOCKING BLOCKING

**!!WARNING!!** As a part of this change we now explicitly set
`process.stdout` and `process.stderr` to be _blocking_ if they are ttys,
using [set-blocking](https://www.npmjs.com/package/set-blocking). This is
necessary to ensure that we can fully erase the progress bar before we start
writing other things out to the console.

Prior to Node.js 6.0.0, they were already blocking on Windows, and MacOS.
Meanwhile, on Linux they were always non-blocking but had large (64kb)
buffers, which largely made this a non-issue there.  Starting with Node.js
6.0.0 they became non-blocking on MacOS and that caused some unexpected
issues (see [nodejs/node#6456](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/6456)).

If you are a Linux user, it's plausible that this might have a performance
impact if your terminal can't keep up with output rate.  If you experience
this, we want to know! Please [file an
issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/new) at our issue tracker.

##### BETTER LAYOUT

Let's start by talking about what goes into the new progress bar:

```
⸨░░░░░░░░░░⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⸩ ⠹ loadExtraneous: verb afterAdd /Users/rebecca/.npm/null/0.0.0/package/package.json written

 percent complete     spinner    current thing we're doing     most recent log line
```

The _spinner_ is intended as an activity indicator–it moves whenever
npm sends something to its logs.  It also spins at a constant speed while
waiting on the network.

The _current thing we're doing_ relates to how we track how much work has
been done.  It's the name of the unit of work we most recently started or
completed some of.  Sometimes these names are more obvious than others and
that's something we'll look at improving over time.

And finally, the _most recent log line_ is exactly that, it's the most
recent line that you would have seen if you were running with
`--loglevel=silly` or were watching the `npm-debug.log`.  These are written
to be useful to the npm developers above all else, so they may sometimes be
a little cryptic.

  `npmlog@3.1.2`: Update to the latest npmlog, which includes the new and
  improved progress bar layout.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

##### MORE PERFORMANT

The underlying code for the progress bar was rewritten, in part with
performance in mind.  Previously whenever you updated the progress bar it
would check an internal variable for how long it had been since the last
update and if it had been long enough, it would print out what you gave it.
With the new progress bar we do updates at a fixed interval (with
`setInterval`) and "updating" the progress bar just updates some variables
that will be used when the next tick of the progress bar happens. Currently
progress bar updates happen every 50ms, although that's open to tuning.

##### WIDE(R) COMPATIBILITY

I spent a lot of time working our Unicode support.  There were a few issues
that plagued us:

Previously one of the characters we used was _ambiguous width_ which means
that it was possible to configure your terminal to display it as _full
width_.  If you did this, the output would be broken because we assumed it
was a _half width_ character. We no longer use any of these characters.

Previously, we defaulted to using Unicode on Windows.  This isn't a safe
assumption, however, as folks in non-US locales often use other code pages
for their terminals.  Windows doesn't provide* any facility available to
Node.js for determining the current code page, so we no longer try to use
Unicode on Windows.

_\* The facilities it does provide are a command line tool and a windows
system call.  The former isn't satisfactory for speed reasons and the latter
can't be accessed from a JS-only Node.js program._

##### FOR THE FUTURE: THEMES

The new version of the progress bar library supports plugable themes. Adding
support to npm shouldn't be too difficult. The built in themes are:

* `ASCII` – The fallback theme which is always available.
* `colorASCII` – Inverts the color of the completed portion of the progress
  bar.  The default on Windows and usually on Linux.  (Color support is
  determined by looking at the `TERM` environment variable.)
* `brailleSpinner` – A braille based spinner and other unicode enhancements. MacOS only.
* `colorBrailleSpinner` – The default on MacOS, a combination of the above two.

##### LESS GARBLED OUTPUT

As a part of landing this I've also taken the opportunity to more
systematically disable the progress bar prior to printing to `stdout` or
running external commands (in particular: git).  This should ensure that the
progress bar doesn't get left on screen after something else prints
something.  We also are now much more zealous about erasing the progress bar
on exit, so if you `Ctrl-C` out of an install we'll still cleanup the
progress bar.

  [#12754](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12754)
  Use `asap` in preference over `process.nextTick` to avoid recursion warnings.
  Under the hood `asap` uses `setImmediate` when available and falls back to
  `process.nextTick` when it's not.  Versions of node that don't support
  `setImmediate` have a version of `process.nextTick` that actually behaves
  like the current `setImmediate`.
  ([@lxe](https://github.com/lxe))

#### FIXES AND REFACTORING

Sometimes the installer would get it into its head that it could move or
remove things that it really shouldn't have.  While the reproducers for this were
often a bit complicated (the core reproducer involved five symlinks(!)), it turns
out this is an easy scenario to end up in if your project has a bunch of small
modules and you're linking them while developing them.

Fixing this ended up involving doing an important and overdue rewrite of how
the installer keeps track of (and interrogates) the relationships between
modules.  This likely fixes other related bugs, and in the coming weeks
we'll verify and close them as we find them.  There are a whole slew of
commits related to this rewrite, and if you'd like to learn more check
out the PR where I describe what I did in detail: [#12775](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/12775)

This week continues our current `big-bug` squashing push, although there's none
that are ready to release quite yet -- we're working on it!

It's also worth noting that we're entering the main part of conference season,
so you can probably expect a bit of a dev slowdown as a lot of us wombats attend
or speak at the various conferences. Remember [npm.camp](npm.camp) is happening
in 2 months and the lineup is looking pretty great! Tickets are still on sale.

### v3.9.3 (2016-05-19):

This week continues our `big-bug` squashing adventure! Things are churning along
nicely, and we've gotten a lot of fantastic contributions from the community.
Please keep it up!

A quick note on last week's release: We had a small `npm shrinkwrap`-related
crasher in `npm@3.9.1`, so once this release goes out, `v3.9.2` is going to be
`npm@latest`. Please update if you ended up in with that previous version!

Remember we have a weekly team meeting, and you can [suggest agenda items in the
GitHub issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12761). Keep an eye out for the
`#npmweekly` tag on Twitter, too, and join the conversation! We'll do our best
to address questions y'all send us. ✌

  [#12685](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/12685)
  When using `npm ls <pkg>` without a semver specifier, `npm ls` would skip
  any packages in your tree that matched by name, but had a prerelease version
  in their `package.json`. This patch fixes it so `npm ls` does a simple name
  match unless you use the `npm ls <pkg>@<version>` format.

HI all!  We have bug fixes to a couple of the hairy corners of `npm`, in the
form of shrinkwraps and bundled dependencies. Plus some documentation improvements
and our lodash deps bot a bump.

This is our first week really focused on getting the
[big bugs](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label:big-bug)

### v3.9.0 (2016-05-05)

Wow!  This is a big release week!  We've completed the fixes that let the
test suite pass on Windows, plus more general bug fixes we found while
fixing things on Windows.  Plus a warning to help folks work around a common
footgun.  PLUS an improvement to how npm works with long cache timeouts.

#### INFINITE CACHE A LITTLE BETTER

* [`111ae3e`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/111ae3ec366ece7ebcf5988f5bc2a7cd70737dfe)
  [#8581](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8581)
  When a package is fetched from the cache which cannot satisfy the version
  requirements, an attempt to fetch it from the network is made.  This is
  helpful for folks using high values for `--cache-min` who are willing to
  accept possibly not-the-most-recent modules in return for less network
  traffic.
  ([@Zirak](https://github.com/Zirak))

#### WARNING: FOOTGUN

* [`60b9a05`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/60b9a051aa46b8892fe63b3681839a6fd6642bfd)
  [#12475](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/12475)
  Options can only start with ASCII dashes.  Ordinarily this isn't a problem
  but many web documentation tools "helpfully" convert `--` into an emdash
  (–), or `-` into an endash (–).  If you copy and paste from this documentation
  your commands won't work the way you expect. This adds a warning that tries
  to be a little more descriptive about why your command is failing.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### WINDOWS CI

We have [Windows CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/npm/npm) setup now! We still have to
tweak it a little bit around paths to the git binaries, but it's otherwise ready!

  ([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23))

automatically [update Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/npm/npm) with
results from [Travis CI](travis-ci.org/npm/npm) runs.

#### WINDOWS REFACTORING

* [`f07e643`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/f07e6430d4ca02f811138f6140a8bad927607a1f)
  [#11444](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444)
  Move exec path escaping out to its own function.  This turns out to be
  tricky to get right because how you escape commands to run on Windows via
  cmd is different then how you escape them at other times.  Specifically,
  you HAVE to quote each directory segment that has a quote in it, that is:
  `C:\"Program Files"\MyApp\MyApp.exe` By contrast, if that were an argument
  to a command being run, you CAN'T DO quote it that way, instead you have
  to wrap the entire path in quotes, like so: `"C:\Program
  Files\MyApp\MyApp.exe"`.

  Create a single function for detecting if we're running on Windows (and
  using a Windows shell like cmd) and use this instead of doing it one-off
  all over the place.

### v3.8.9 (2016-04-28)

Our biggest news this week is that we got the
[Windows test suite passing](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444)!
It'll take a little longer to get it passing in our
[Windows CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/npm/npm/) but that's coming
soon too.

That means we'll be shifting gears away from tests to fixing
[Big Bugs™](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abig-bug) again.
Join us at our [team meeting](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12517) next

  a folder.

### v3.8.8 (2016-04-21)

Hi all! Long time no see! We've been heads-down working through getting
[our test suite passing on Windows](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444).
Did you know that we have
[Windows CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/npm/npm) now running over at
Appveyor?  In the meantime, we've got a bunch of dependency updates, some
nice documentation improvements and error messages when your `package.json`
contains invalid JSON. (Yeah, I thought we did that last one before too!)

  There were bugs where modules whose names matched the special files that npm always
  includes would be included, for example, the `history` package was always included.

  With `npm@3` such extraneously bundled modules would not be ordinarily
  used, as things in `node_modules` in packages are ignored entirely if the
  package isn't marked as bundling modules.

  Because of this `npm@3` behavior, the `files-and-ignores` test failed to catch this as
  it was testing _install output_ not what got packed. That has also been fixed.

### v3.8.6 (2016-03-31)

Heeeeeey y'all.

Kat here! Rebecca's been schmoozing with folks at [Microsoft
Build](https://build.microsoft.com/), so I'm doing the `npm@3` release this
week.

Speaking of Build, it looks like Microsoft is doing some bash thing. This might
be really good news for our Windows users once it rolls around. We're keeping an
eye out and feeling hopeful. 🙆

As far as the release goes: We're really happy to be getting more and more
community contributions! Keep it up! We really appreciate folks trying to help
us, and we'll do our best to help point you in the right direction. Even things
like documentation are a huge help. And remember -- you get socks for it, too!

#### FIXES

* [`f8fb4d8`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/f8fb4d83923810eb78d075bd200a9376c64c3e3a)
  [#12079](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/12079)
  Back in `npm@3.2.2` we included [a patch that made it so `npm install pkg` was
  basically `npm install pkg@latest` instead of
  `pkg@*`](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9170)
  This is probably what most users expected, but it also ended up [breaking `npm
  deprecate`](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9170) when no version was provided
  for a package. In that case, we were using `*` to mean "deprecate all
  versions" and relying on the `pkg` -> `pkg@*` conversion.
  This patch fixes `npm deprecate pkg` to work as it used to by special casing
  that particular command's behavior.

### v3.8.4 (2016-03-24)

Was erroneously released with just a changelog typo correction and was
otherwise the same as 3.8.3.

### v3.8.3 (2016-03-17):

#### SECURITY ADVISORY: BEARER TOKEN DISCLOSURE

This release includes [the fix for a
vulnerability](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/f67ecad59e99a03e5aad8e93cd1a086ae087cb29)
that could cause the unintentional leakage of bearer tokens.

Here are details on this vulnerability and how it affects you.

##### DETAILS

Since 2014, npm’s registry has used HTTP bearer tokens to authenticate requests
from the npm’s command-line interface. A design flaw meant that the CLI was
sending these bearer tokens with _every_ request made by logged-in users,
regardless of the destination of their request. (The bearers only should have
been included for requests made against a registry or registries used for the
current install.)

An attacker could exploit this flaw by setting up an HTTP server that could
collect authentication information, then use this authentication information to
impersonate the users whose tokens they collected. This impersonation would
allow them to do anything the compromised users could do, including publishing
new versions of packages.

With the fixes we’ve released, the CLI will only send bearer tokens with
requests made against a registry.

##### THINK YOU'RE AT RISK? REGENERATE YOUR TOKENS

If you believe that your bearer token may have been leaked, [invalidate your
current npm bearer tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/tokens) and rerun
`npm login` to generate new tokens. Keep in mind that this may cause continuous
integration builds in services like Travis to break, in which case you’ll need
to update the tokens in your CI server’s configuration.

##### WILL THIS BREAK MY CURRENT SETUP?

Maybe.

npm’s CLI team believes that the fix won’t break any existing registry setups.
Due to the large number of registry software suites out in the wild, though,
it’s possible our change will be breaking in some cases.

If so, please [file an issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/new) describing
the software you’re using and how it broke. Our team will work with you to
mitigate the breakage.

##### CREDIT & THANKS

Thanks to Mitar, Will White & the team at Mapbox, Max Motovilov, and James
Taylor for reporting this vulnerability to npm.

#### PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

The updated [`are-we-there-yet`](https://npmjs.com/package/are-we-there-yet)
changes how it tracks how complete things are to be much more efficient.
The summary is that `are-we-there-yet` was refactored to remove an expensive
tree walk.

The result for you should be faster installs when working with very large trees.

Previously `are-we-there-yet` computed this when you asked by passing the request down
its tree of progress indicators, totaling up the results. In doing so, it had to walk the
entire tree of progress indicators.

By contrast, `are-we-there-yet` now updates a running total when a change
is made, bubbling that up the tree from whatever branch made progress.  This
bubbling was already going on so there was nearly no cost associated with taking advantage of it.

### v3.8.1 (2016-03-03):

This week the install summary got better, killing your npm process now
also kills the scripts it was running and a rarely used search flag got
documented.

Our improvements on the test suite on Windows are beginning to pick up
steam, you can follow along by
[watching the PR](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444).

#### BETTER INSTALL SUMMARIES

  [#11699](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/11699)
  Ensure that flags like `--production` passed to install don't result in
  the summary at the end being incorrectly filtered. That summary is
  produced by the same code as `npm ls` and therefore responds to flags
  the same way it does. This is undesirable when it's an install summary,
  however, as we don't want it to filter anything.

  This fixes an issue where `npm install --production <module>` would
  result in npm exiting with an error code. The `--production` flag would
  make `npm ls` filter out `<module>` as it wasn't saved to the
  `package.json` and thus wasn't a production dependency. The install
  report is limited to show just the modules installed, so with that
  filtered out nothing is available. With nothing available `npm ls`
  would set `npm` to exit with an error code.

### v3.8.0 (2016-02-25):

This week brings a quality of life improvement for some Windows users, and
an important knob to be tuned for folks experiencing network problems.

#### LIMIT CONCURRENT REQUESTS

We've long known that `npm`'s tendency to try to request all your
dependencies simultaneously upset some network hardware (particular,
consumer grade routers & proxies of all sorts). One of the reasons that we're
planning to write our own npm specific version of `request` is to be able to
more easily control this sort of thing.

But fortunately, you don't have to wait for that.
[@misterbyrne](https://github.com/misterbyrne) took a look at our existing
code and realized it could be added painlessly TODAY.  The new default
maximum is `50`, instead of `Infinity`.  If you're having network issues you
can try setting that value down to something lower (if you do, please let us
know...  the default is subject to tuning).

#### WHITTLING AWAY AT PATH LENGTHS

So for all of you who don't know -- Node.js does, in fact, support long Windows
paths. Unfortunately, depending on the tool and the Windows version, a lot of
external tooling does not. This means, for example, that some (all?) versions of
Windows Explorer *can literally never delete npm from their system entirely
because of deeply-nested npm dependencies*. Which is pretty gnarly.

Incidentally, if you run into that in particularly, you can use
[rimraf](npm.im/rimraf) to remove such files 💁.

The latest victim of this issue was the Node.js CI setup for testing on Windows,
which uses some tooling or another that croaks on the usual path length limit
for that OS: 255 characters.

This isn't ordinarily an issue with `npm@3` as it produces mostly flat
trees, but you may be surprised to learn that `npm`'s own distribution isn't
flat, due to needing to be compatible with `npm@1.2`, which ships with
`node@0.8`!

We've taken another baby step towards alleviating this in this release by
updating a couple of dependencies that were preventing `npmlog` from deduping,
and then doing a dedupe on that and `gauge`. Hopefully it helps.

#### INTERNAL TEST IMPROVEMENTS

The `npm` core team's time recently has been sunk into `npm`'s many years of
tech debt. Specifically, we've been working on improving the test suite.
This isn't user visible, but in future should mean a more stable, easier to
contribute to `npm`. Ordinarily we don't report these kinds of changes in
the change log, but I thought I might share this week as this chunk is

### v3.7.3 (2016-02-11):

Hey all! We've got a pretty small release this week -- just documentation
updates and a couple of dependencies. This release also includes a particular
dependency upgrade that makes it so we're exclusively using the latest version
of `graceful-fs`, which'll make it so things keep working with future Node.js
releases.

A certain internal Node.js API was deprecated and slated for future removal from
Node Core. This API was critical for versions of `graceful-fs@<4`, before a
different approach was used to achieve similar ends. By upgrading this library,
and making sure all our dependencies are also updated, we've ensured npm will
continue to work once the API is finally removed. Older versions of npm, on the
other hand, will simply not work on future versions of Node.js.

### v3.7.0 (2016-01-29):

Hi all! This week brings us some important performance improvements,
support for git submodules(!) and a bunch of bug fixes.

#### PERFORMANCE

`gauge`, the module responsible for drawing `npm`'s progress bars, had an
embarrassing bug in its debounce implementation that resulted in it, on many
systems, actually being _slower_ than if it hadn't been debouncing. This was
due to it destroying and then creating a timer object any time it got an
update while waiting on its minimum update period to elapse. This only was
a measurable slowdown when sending thousands of updates a second, but
unfortunately parts of `npm`'s logging do exactly that. This has been patched
to eliminate that churn, and our testing shows the progress bar as being
eliminated as a source of slow down.

Meanwhile, `are-we-there-yet` is the module that tracks just how complete
our big asynchronous install process is. [@STRML](https://github.com/STRML)
spent some time auditing its source and made a few smaller performance
improvements to it. Most impactful was eliminating a bizarre bit of code
that was both binding to AND closing over the current object. I don't have
any explanation for how that crept in. =D

* [`c680fa9`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/c680fa9f8135759eb5512f4b86e47fa265733f79)
  `npmlog@2.0.2`: New `are-we-there-yet` with performance patches from
  [@STRML](https://github.com/STRML). New `gauge` with timer churn
  performance patch.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

We were also using `lodash`'s `cloneDeep` on `package.json` data which is
definitely overkill, seeing as `package.json` data has all the restrictions
of being `json`. The fix for this is just swapping that out for something
that does a pair of `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse`, which is distinctly more
speedy.

* [`1d1ea7e`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/1d1ea7eeb958034878eb6573149aeecc686888d3)
  [#11306](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11306)
  Use JSON clone instead of `lodash.cloneDeep`.
  ([@STRML](https://github.com/STRML))

#### NEW FEATURE: GIT SUBMODULE SUPPORT

Long, long requested– the referenced issue is from 2011– we're finally
getting rudimentary git submodule support.

* [`39dea9c`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/39dea9ca4216c6ea628f5ca47d2b34a4b251a1ed)
  [#1876](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/1876)
  Add support for git submodules in git remotes. This is a fairly simple
  approach, which does not leverage the git caching mechanism to cache
  submodules. It also doesn't provide a means to disable automatic
  initialization, e.g. via a setting in the `.gitmodules` file.

#### ROBUSTNESS

* [`5dec02a`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/5dec02a3d0e82202c021e27aff9d006283fdc25a)
  [#10347](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10347)
  There is an obscure feature that lets you monkey-patch npm when it starts
  up. If the module being required with this feature failed, it would
  previously just make `npm` error out– this reduces that to a warning.

  [#10063](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10063)
  Fix a bug where `npm` would change the order of array properties in the
  `package.json` files of dependencies.  `npm` adds a bunch of stuff to
  `package.json` files in your `node_modules` folder for debugging and
  bookkeeping purposes.  As a part of this process it sorts the object to
  reduce file churn when it does updates.  This fixes a bug where the arrays
  in the object were also getting sorted.  This wasn't a problem for
  properties that `npm` itself maintains, but _is_ a problem for properties
  used by other packages.

### v3.6.0 (2016-01-20):

Hi all!  This is a bigger release, in part 'cause we didn't have one last
week. The most important thing you need to know is that when `npm@3.6.0` replaces
`npm@3.5.4` as `next`, `npm@3.5.4` WILL NOT be moved on to `latest`. This is due to
a packaging error that tickles bugs in some earlier releases and makes upgrades to it
from those versions break the install.

  [#10717](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10717)
  `npm version` can now take a `from-git` argument, which instructs `npm` to read the
  version from git and update your `package.json` to what it finds. This is in contrast
  to its normal use where `npm` _tells_ git about your new version.

#### 3.5.4 WAS NOT SO GREAT

The `npm@3.5.4` package was missing some dependencies.  Specifically, `glob`
and `has-unicode` had major release updates which meant that subdeps that
relied on older major versions couldn't use the npm supplied versions any
more, and so they needed their own copies.

This went undetected because the actions necessary to run the tests (which
check for this sort of thing) resolved the missing modules.

Further, it didn't have symptoms when upgrading from _most_ versions of npm.
Unfortunately, some versions had bugs that were tickled by this and resulted
in broken upgrades, most notably, `npm@3.3.12`, the version that's been in
Node.js 5.

#### WHEN MISSING PATHS ARE OK

  [#11212](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11212)
  When trying to determine if a file was controlled by npm before going to
  remove it, we check to see if it is inside any of a list of paths that npm
  considers to be under its control.  Not all of those paths always exist
  (and that's ok!) Previously we were calling it a failure to match if ANY
  of them didn't exist.  We now only do so if NONE of them exist.  If some
  do, then we do our usual checks on them.

  This showed up as an error where you would see something like:
  ```
  npm warn gentlyRm not removing /path/to/thing as it wasn't installed by /path/to/other/thing
  ```
  But it totally was installed by it.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### BETTER NODE PRE-RELEASE SUPPORT

Historically, if you used a pre-release version of Node.js, you would get
dozens and dozens of warnings when EVERY engine check failed across all of
your modules, because `>= 0.10.0` doesn't match prereleases.

You might find this stream of redundent warnings undesirable. I do.

We've moved this into a SINGLE warning you'll get about using a pre-release
version of Node.js and now suppress those other warnings.

  [#10938](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10938)
  When removing a package, sometimes the `node_modules/.bin` wouldn't be
  cleaned up entirely.  This would result in package folders that contained
  only a `node_modules/.bin` directory.  In turn, this would result in `npm
  ls` and other tools complaining about these broken directories.
  To fix this, the `unbuild` step now explicitly deletes the
  `node_modules/.bin` folder as its final step.

  When replacing the `package.json` in the cache you sometimes see `EPERM` errors on

  and allows Windows to continue. Longer term, we'll be adding something to retry
  these errors, but ultimately fail if there really is an ongoing permissions issue.

### v3.5.4 (2016-01-07):

I hope you all had fantastic winter holidays, if it's winter where you are
and if there are holidays‼ We went a few weeks without releases because
staff was taking time away from work here and there.  A new year has come
and we're back now, and refreshed and ready to dig in!

  Work around Node.js 0.8 http back-pressure bug.

  0.8 http streams have a bug, where if they're paused with data in their
  buffers when the socket closes, they call `end` before emptying those
  buffers, which results in the entire pipeline ending and thus the point
  that applied backpressure never being able to trigger a `resume`.

  We work around this by piping into a pass through stream that has
  unlimited buffering.  The pass through stream is from readable-stream and
  is thus a current streams3 implementation that is free of these bugs even
  on 0.8.

`registry.npmjs.com` and this has been corrected to `registry.npmjs.org`.

#### ENOENT? MORE LIKE ENOMOREBUGS

The headliner this week was uncovered by the fixes to bundled dependency
handling over the past few releases. What had been a frustratingly
intermittent and hard to reproduce bug became something that happened
every time in Travis. This fixes another whole bunch of errors where you
would, while running an install have it crash with an `ENOENT` on
`rename`, or the install would finish but some modules would be
mysteriously missing and you'd have to install a second time.

What's going on was a bit involved, so bear with me:

`npm@3` generates a list of actions to take against the tree on disk.
With the exception of lifecycle scripts, it expects these all to be able
to act independently without interfering with each other.

This means, for instance, that one should be able to upgrade `b` in
`a→b→c` without having npm reinstall `c`.

That works fine by the way.

But it also means that the move action should be able to move `b` in
`a→b→c@1.0.1` to `a→d→b→c@1.0.2` without moving or removing `c@1.0.1` and
while leaving `c@1.0.2` in place if it was already installed.

That is, the `move` action moves an individual node, replacing itself
with an empty spot if it had children. This is not, as it might first
appear, something where you move an entire branch to another location on
the tree.

When moving `b` we already took care to leave `c@1.0.1` in place so that
other moves (or removes) could handle it, but we were stomping on the
destination and so `c@1.0.2` was being removed.

  [#10655](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10655)
  Preserve destination `node_modules` when moving.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

There was also a bug with `remove` where it was pruning the entire tree
at the remove point, prior to running moves and adds.

This was fine most of the time, but if we were moving one of the deps out
from inside it, kaboom.

* [`19c626d`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/19c626d69888f0cdc6e960254b3fdf523ec4b52c)
  [#10655](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10655)
  Get rid of the remove commit phase– we could have it prune _just_ the
  module being removed, but that isn't gaining us anything.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

After all that, we shouldn't be upgrading the `add` of a bundled package
to a `move`. Moves save us from having to extract the package, but with a
bundled dependency it's included in another package already so that
doesn't gain us anything.

#### NO MORE MD5

We updated modules that had been using MD5 for non-security purposes.
While this is perfectly safe, if you compile Node in FIPS-compliance mode
it will explode if you try to use MD5. We've replaced MD5 with Murmur,
which conveys our intent better and is faster to boot.

### v3.5.1 (2015-11-25):

#### THE npm CLI !== THE npm REGISTRY !== npm, INC.

npm-the-CLI is licensed under the terms of the [Artistic License
2.0](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/8d79c1a39dae908f27eaa37ff6b23515d505ef29/LICENSE),
which is a liberal open-source license that allows you to take this code and do
pretty much whatever you like with it (that is, of course, not legal language,
and if you're doing anything with npm that leaves you in doubt about your legal
rights, please seek the review of qualified counsel, which is to say, not
members of the CLI team, none of whom have passed the bar, to my knowledge). At
the same time the primary registry the CLI uses when looking up and downloading
packages is a commercial service run by npm, Inc., and it has its own [Terms of
Use](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/terms).

Aside from clarifying the terms of use (and trying to make sure they're more
widely known), the only recent changes to npm's licenses have been making the
split between the CLI and registry clearer. You are still free to do whatever
you like with the CLI's source, and you are free to view, download, and publish
packages to and from `registry.npmjs.org`, but now the existing terms under
which you can do so are more clearly documented. Aside from the two commits
below, see also [the release notes for
`npm@3.4.1`](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.4.1), which is where
the split between the CLI's code and the terms of use for the registry was
first made more clear.

#### THE ONGOING SAGA OF BUNDLED DEPENDENCIES

`npm@3.5.0` fixed up a serious issue with how `npm@3.4.1` (and potentially
`npm@3.4.0` and `npm@3.3.12`) handled the case in which dependencies bundled
into a package tarball are handled improperly when one or more of their own
dependencies are older than what's latest on the registry. Unfortunately, in
fixing that (quite severe) regression (see [`npm@3.5.0`'s release notes' for
details](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.5.0)), we introduced a new
(small, and fortunately cosmetic) issue where npm superfluously warns you about
bundled dependencies being stale. We have now fixed that, and hope that we
haven't introduced any _other_ regressions in the process. :D

### v3.5.0 (2015-11-19):

#### TEEN ORCS AT THE GATES

This week heralds the general release of the primary npm registry's [new
support for private packages for
organizations](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/133542170540/private-packages-for-organizations).
For many potential users, it's the missing piece needed to make it easy for you
to move your organization's private work onto npm. And now it's here! The
functionality to support it has been in place in the CLI for a while now,
thanks to [@zkat](https://github.com/zkat)'s hard work.

During our final testing before the release, our ace support team member
[@snopeks](https://github.com/snopeks) noticed that there had been some drift
between the CLI team's implementation and what npm was actually preparing to
ship. In the interests of everyone having a smooth experience with this
_extremely useful_ new feature, we quickly made a few changes to square up the
CLI and the web site experiences.

#### NON-OPTIONAL INSTALLS, DEFINITELY NON-OPTIONAL

* [`180263b`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/180263b)
  [#10465](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10465)
  When a non-optional dep fails, we check to see if it's only required by
  ONLY optional dependencies.  If it is, we make it fail all the deps in
  that chain (and roll them back).  If it isn't then we give an error.

  We do this by walking up through all of our ancestors until we either hit an
  optional dependency or the top of the tree. If we hit the top, we know to
  give the error.

  If you installed a module by hand but didn't `--save` it, your module
  won't have the top of the tree as an anscestor and so this code was
  failing to abort the install with an error

  This updates the logic so that hitting the top OR a module that was
  requested by the user will trigger the error message.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

* [`b726a0e`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/b726a0e)
  [#9204](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9204)
  Ideally we would like warnings about your install to come AFTER the
  output from your compile steps or the giant tree of installed modules.

  To that end, we've moved warnings about failed optional deps to the show
  after your install completes.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### OVERRIDING BUNDLING

* [`aed71fb`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/aed71fb)
  [#10482](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10482)
  We've been in our bundled modules code a lot lately, and our last go at
  this introduced a new bug, where if you had a module `a` that bundled
  a module `b`, which in turn required `c`, and the version of `c` that
  got bundled wasn't compatible with `b`'s `package.json`, we would then
  install a compatible version of `c`, but also erase `b` at the same time.

  This fixes that. It also reworks our bundled module support to be much
  closer to being in line with how we handle non-bundled modules and we're
  hopeful this will reduce any future errors around them. The new structure
  is hopefully much easier to reason about anyway.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### A BRIEF NOTE ON NPM'S BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY

We don't often have much to say about the changes we make to our internal
testing and tooling, but I'm going to take this opportunity to reiterate that
npm tries hard to maintain compatibility with a wide variety of Node versions.
As this change shows, we want to ensure that npm works the same across:

* Node.js 0.8
* Node.js 0.10
* Node.js 0.12
* the latest io.js release
* Node.js 4 LTS
* Node.js 5

Contributors who send us pull requests often notice that it's very rare that
our tests pass across all of those versions (ironically, almost entirely due to
the packages we use for testing instead of any issues within npm itself). We're
currently beginning an effort, lasting the rest of 2015, to clean up our test
suite, and not only get it passing on all of the above versions of Node.js, but
working solidly on Windows as well. This is a compounding form of technical
debt that we're finally paying down, and our hope is that cleaning up the tests
will produce a more robust CLI that's a lot easier to write patches for.

  [#10337](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10337)
  Add two new flags, first `--legacy-bundling` which installs your
  dependencies such that if you bundle those dependencies, npm versions
  prior to `1.4` can still install them. This eliminates all automatic
  deduping.

  Second, `--global-style` which will install modules in your `node_modules`
  folder with the same layout as global modules.  Only your direct
  dependencies will show in `node_modules` and everything they depend on
  will be flattened in their `node_modules` folders.  This obviously will
  eliminate some deduping.

### v3.4.1 (2015-11-12):

#### ASK FOR NOTHING, GET LATEST

When you run `npm install foo`, you probably expect that you'll get the
`latest` version of `foo`, whatever that is. And good news! That's what
this change makes it do.

We _think_ this is what everyone wants, but if this causes problems for
you, we want to know! If it proves problematic for people we will consider
reverting it (preferably before this becomes `npm@latest`).

Previously, when you ran `npm install foo` we would act as if you typed
`npm install foo@*`. Now, like any range-type specifier, in addition to
matching the range, it would also have to be `<=` the value of the
`latest` dist-tag. Further, it would exclude prerelease versions from the
list of versions considered for a match.

This worked as expected most of the time, unless your `latest` was a
prerelease version, in which case that version wouldn't be used, to
everyone's surprise. Worse, if all your versions were prerelease versions
it would just refuse to install anything. (We fixed that in
[`npm@3.2.2`](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.2.2) with
[`e4a38080`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/e4a38080).)

#### A NEW FEATURE

This was a group effort, with [@isaacs](https://github.com/isaacs)

[@ashleygwilliams](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams) wrote up docs and
just today [@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23) wrote a test.

It's a handy shortcut to update a dependency and then make sure tests
still pass.

```
npm install-test x
```

is the equivalent of running:

```
npm install x && npm test

### v3.3.12 (2015-11-02):

Hi, a little hot-fix release for a bug introduced in 3.3.11.  The ENOENT fix
last week ([`f0e2088`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/f0e2088)) broke
upgrades of modules that have bundled dependencies (like `npm`, augh!)

* [`aedf7cf`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/aedf7cf)
  [#10192](//github.com/npm/npm/pull/10192)
  If a bundled module is going to be replacing a module that's currently on
  disk (for instance, when you upgrade a module that includes bundled
  dependencies) we want to select the version from the bundle in preference
  over the one that was there previously.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

### v3.3.11 (2015-10-29):

This is a dependency update week, so that means no PRs from our lovely
users. Look for those next week.  As it happens, the dependencies updated
were just devdeps, so nothing for you all to worry about.

But the bug fixes, oh geez, I tracked down some really long standing stuff
this week!!  The headliner is those intermittent `ENOENT` errors that no one
could reproduce consistently?  I think they're nailed! But also pretty
important, the bug where `hapi` would install w/ a dep missing? Squashed!

#### EEEEEEENOENT

* [`f0e2088`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/f0e2088)
  [#10026](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10026)
  Eliminate some, if not many, of the `ENOENT` errors `npm@3` has seen over
  the past few months.  This was happening when npm would, in its own mind,
  correct a bundled dependency, due to a `package.json` specifying an
  incompatible version.  Then, when npm extracted the bundled version, what
  was on disk didn't match its mind and… well, when it tried to act on what
  was in its mind, we got an `ENOENT` because it didn't actually exist on
  disk.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### PARTIAL SHRINKWRAPS, NO LONGER A BAD DAY

* [`712fd9c`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/712fd9c)
  [#10153](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10153)
  Imagine that you have a module, let's call it `fun-time`, and it depends
  on two dependencies, `need-fun@1` and `need-time`.  Further, `need-time`
  requires `need-fun@2`.  So after install the logical tree will look like
  this:

  ```
  fun-time
  ├── need-fun@1
  └── need-time
      └── need-fun@2
  ```

  Now, the `fun-time` author also distributes a shrinkwrap, but it only includes
  the `need-fun@1` in it.

  Resolving dependencies would look something like this:

  1. Require `need-fun@1`: Use version from shrinkwrap (ignoring version)
  2. Require `need-time`: User version in package.json
    1. Require `need-fun@2`: Use version from shrinkwrap, which oh hey, is
       already installed at the top level, so no further action is needed.

  Which results in this tree:

  ```
  fun-time
  ├── need-fun@1
  └── need-time
  ```

  We're ignoring the version check on things specified in the shrinkwrap
  so that you can override the version that will be installed. This is
  because you may want to  use a different version than is specified
  by your dependencies' dependencies' `package.json` files.

  To fix this, we now only allow overrides of a dependency version when
  that dependency is a child (in the tree) of the thing that requires it.
  This means that when we're looking for `need-fun@2` we'll see `need-fun@1`
  and reject it because, although it's from a shrinkwrap, it's parent is
  `fun-time` and the package doing the requiring is `need-time`.

  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### STRING `package.bin` AND NON-NPMJS REGISTRIES

* [`3de1463`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/3de1463)
  [#9187](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9187)
  If you were using a module with the `bin` field in your `package.json` set
  to a string on a non-npmjs registry then npm would crash, due to the our
  expectation that the `bin` field would be an object.  We now pass all
  `package.json` data through a routine that normalizes the format,
  including the `bin` field.  (This is the same routine that your
  `package.json` is passed through when read off of disk or sent to the
  registry for publication.) Doing this also ensures that older modules on
  npm's own registry will be treated exactly the same as new ones.  (In the
  past we weren't always super careful about scrubbing `package.json` data
  on publish.  And even when we were, those rules have subtly changed over
  time.)
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

### v3.3.10 (2015-10-22):

Hey you all!  Welcome to a busy bug fix and PR week.  We've got changes
to how `npm install` replaces dependencies during updates, improvements
to shrinkwrap behavior, and all sorts of doc updates.

In other news, `npm@3` landed in node master in preparation for `node@5`
with [`41923c0`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/41923c0).

#### UPDATED DEPS NOW MAKE MORE SENSE

  [#9929](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9929)

[`22a3af0`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/22a3af0) from last week's
release, as it is resulting in crashes.  We'll revisit this PR during this

  Revert "lifecycle: Swap out custom logic with add-to-path module"
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

### v3.3.7 (2015-10-08):

So, as Kat mentioned in last week's 2.x release, we're now swapping weeks
between accepting PRs and doing dependency updates, in an effort to keep
release management work from taking over our lives.  This week is a PR week,
so we've got a bunch of goodies for you.

Relatedly, this week means 3.3.6 is now `latest` and it is WAY faster than
previous 3.x releases. Give it or this a look!

#### OPTIONAL DEPS, MORE OPTIONAL

* [`2289234`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/2289234)
  [#9643](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9643)
  [#9664](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9664)
  `npm@3` was triggering `npm@2`'s build mechanics when it was linking bin files
  into the tree.  This was originally intended to trigger rebuilds of
  bundled modules, but `npm@3`'s flat module structure confused it.  This
  caused two seemingly unrelated issues.  First, failing optional
  dependencies could under some circumstances (if they were built during
  this phase) trigger a full build failure.  And second, rebuilds were being
  triggered of already installed modules, again, in some circumstances.
  Both of these are fixed by disabling the `npm@2` mechanics and adding a
  special rebuild phase for the initial installation of bundled modules.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### BAD NAME, NO CRASH

* [`b78fec9`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/b78fec9)
  [#9766](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9766)
  Refactor all attempts to read the module name or package name to go via a

### v3.3.6 (2015-09-30):

I have the most exciting news for you this week.  YOU HAVE NO IDEA.  Well,
ok, maybe you do if you follow my twitter.

Performance just got 5 bazillion times better (under some circumstances,
ymmv, etc).  So– my test scenario is our very own website.  In `npm@2`, on my
macbook running `npm ls` takes about 5 seconds. Personally it's more than
I'd like, but it's entire workable. In `npm@3` it has been taking _50_ seconds,
which is appalling. But after doing some work on Monday isolating the performance
issues I've been able to reduce `npm@3`'s run time back down to 5 seconds.

Other scenarios were even worse, there was one that until now in `npm@3` that
took almost 6 minutes, and has been reduced to 14 seconds.

* [`7bc0d4c`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/7bc0d4c)
  [`cf42217`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/cf42217)
  [#8826](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8826)
  Stop using deepclone on super big datastructures. Avoid cloning
  all-together even when that means mutating things, when possible.
  Otherwise use a custom written tree-copying function that understands
  the underlying datastructure well enough to only copy what we absolutely
  need to.

### v3.3.5 (2015-09-24):

Some of you all may not be aware, but npm is ALSO a company. I tell you this
'cause npm-the-company had an all-staff get together this week, flying in
our remote folks from around the world. That was great, but it also
basically eliminated normal work on Monday and Tuesday.

Still, we've got a couple of really important bug fixes this week.  Plus a
lil bit from the [now LTS 2.x branch](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.6).

#### ATTENTION WINDOWS USERS

If you previously updated to npm 3 and you try to update again, you may get
an error messaging telling you that npm won't install npm into itself. Until you
are at 3.3.5 or greater, you can get around this with `npm install -f -g npm`.

* [`bef06f5`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/bef06f5)
  [#9741](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9741) Uh...  so...  er...  it
  seems that since `npm@3.2.0` on Windows with a default configuration, it's
  been impossible to update npm.  Well, that's not actually true, there's a
  work around (see above), but it shouldn't be complaining in the first
  place.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### STACK OVERFLOWS ON PUBLISH

* [`330b496`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/330b496)
  [#9667](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9667)
  We were keeping track of metadata about your project while packing the
  tree in a way that resulted in this data being written to packed tar files
  headers. When this metadata included cycles, it resulted in the the tar
  file entering an infinite recursive loop and eventually crashing with a
  stack overflow.

  I've patched this by keeping track of your metadata by closing over the
  variables in question instead, and I've further restricted gathering and
  tracking the metadata to times when it's actually needed. (Which is only
  if you need bundled modules.)
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### LESS CRASHY ERROR MESSAGES ON BAD PACKAGES

* [`829921f`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/829921f)
  [#9741](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9741)
  Packages with invalid names or versions were crashing the installer. These
  are now captured and warned as was originally intended.

### v3.3.4 (2015-09-17):

This is a relatively quiet release, bringing a few bug fixes and
some module updates, plus via the
[2.14.5 release](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.5)
some forward compatibility fixes with versions of Node that
aren't yet released.

#### NO BETA NOTICE THIS TIME!!

But, EXCITING NEWS FRIENDS, this week marks the exit of `npm@3`
from beta. This means that the week of this release,
[v3.3.3](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.3.3) will
become `latest` and this version (v3.3.4) will become `next`!!

#### CRUFT FOR THE CRUFT GODS

What I call "cruft", by which I mean, files sitting around in
your `node_modules` folder, will no longer produce warnings in
`npm ls` nor during `npm install`. This brings `npm@3`'s behavior
in line with `npm@2`.

* [`a127801`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/a127801)

This short week brought us brings us a few small bug fixes, a
doc change and a whole lotta dependency updates.

Plus, as usual, this includes a forward port of everything in
[`npm@2.14.4`](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.4).

#### BETA BUT NOT FOREVER

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**. `npm@3` will remain in beta until
we're confident that it's stable and have assessed the effect of
the breaking changes on the community. During that time we will
still be doing `npm@2` releases, with `npm@2` tagged as `latest`
and `next`. We'll _also_ be publishing new releases of `npm@3`
as `npm@v3.x-next` and `npm@v3.x-latest` alongside those
versions until we're ready to switch everyone over to `npm@3`.
We need your help to find and fix its remaining bugs. It's a
significant rewrite, so we are _sure_ there still significant
bugs remaining. So do us a solid and deploy it in non-critical
CI environments and for day-to-day use, but maybe don't use it
for production maintenance or frontline continuous deployment
just yet.

#### REMOVE INSTALLED BINARIES ON WINDOWS

So waaaay back at the start of August, I fixed a bug with
[#9198](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9198). That fix made it
so that if you had two modules installed that both installed the
same binary (eg `gulp` & `gulp-cli`), that removing one wouldn't
remove the binary if it was owned by the other.

It did this by doing some hocus-pocus that, turns out, was
Unix-specific, so on Windows it just threw up its hands and
stopped removing installed binaries at all. Not great.

So today we're fixing that– it let us maintain the same safety
that we added in #9198, but ALSO works with Windows.

  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### API DOCUMENTATION HAS BEEN SACRIFICED THE API GOD

The documentation of the internal APIs of npm is going away,
because it would lead people into thinking they should integrate
with npm by using it. Please don't do that! In the future, we'd
like to give you a suite of stand alone modules that provide
better, more stand alone APIs for your applications to build on.
But for now, call the npm binary with `process.exec` or
`process.spawn` instead.

  ([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23))

#### ALLOW `npm link` ON WINDOWS W/ PRERELEASE VERSIONS OF NODE

We never meant to have this be a restriction in the first place
and it was only just discovered with the recent node 4.0.0
release candidate.

  node
  ([@jon-hall](https://github.com/jon-hall))

#### graceful-fs update

We're updating all of npm's deps to use the most recent
`graceful-fs`. This turns out to be important for future not yet
released versions of node, because older versions monkey-patch
`fs` in ways that will break in the future. Plus it ALSO makes
use of `process.binding` which is an internal API that npm
definitely shouldn't have been using. We're not done yet, but
this is the bulk of them.

### v3.3.2 (2015-09-04):

#### PLEASE HOLD FOR THE NEXT AVAILABLE MAINTAINER

This is a tiny little maintenance release, both to update dependencies and to
keep `npm@3` up to date with changes made to `npm@2`.
[@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23) is putting out this release (again) as
his esteemed colleague [@iarna](https://github.com/iarna) finishes relocating
herself, her family, and her sizable anime collection all the way across North
America. It contains [all the goodies in
`npm@2.14.3`](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.3) and one other
dependency update.

#### BETA WARNINGS FOR FUN AND PROFIT

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**. `npm@3` will remain in beta until we're
confident that it's stable and have assessed the effect of the breaking
changes on the community.  During that time we will still be doing `npm@2`
releases, with `npm@2` tagged as `latest` and `next`.  We'll _also_ be
publishing new releases of `npm@3` as `npm@v3.x-next` and `npm@v3.x-latest`
alongside those versions until we're ready to switch everyone over to
`npm@3`.  We need your help to find and fix its remaining bugs.  It's a
significant rewrite, so we are _sure_ there still significant bugs
remaining.  So do us a solid and deploy it in non-critical CI environments
and for day-to-day use, but maybe don't use it for production maintenance or
frontline continuous deployment just yet.

That said, it's getting there! It will be leaving beta very soon!

### v3.3.1 (2015-08-27):

Hi all, this `npm@3` update brings you another round of bug fixes.  The
headliner here is that `npm update` works again.  We're running down the
clock on blocker 3.x issues!  Shortly after that hits zero we'll be
promoting 3.x to latest!!

And of course, we have changes that were brought forward from 2.x. Check out
the release notes for
[2.14.1](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.1) and
[2.14.2](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.2).

### v3.3.0 (2015-08-13):

This is a pretty EXCITING week.  But I may be a little excitable– or
possibly sleep deprived, it's sometimes hard to tell them apart. =D So
[Kat](https://github.com/zkat) really went the extra mile this week and got
the client side support for teams and orgs out in this week's 2.x release.
You can't use that just yet, 'cause we have to turn on some server side
stuff too, but this way it'll be there for you all the moment we do!  Check
out the details over in the [2.14.0 release
notes](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.0)!

But we over here in 3.x ALSO got a new feature this week, check out the new
`--only` and `--also` flags for better control over when dev and production
dependencies are used by various npm commands.

That, and some important bug fixes round out this week. Enjoy everyone!

#### NEVER SHALL NOT BETA THE BETA

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**.  EXCITING NEW BETA WARNING!!!  Ok, I fibbed,
EXACTLY THE SAME BETA WARNINGS: `npm@3` will remain in beta until we're
confident that it's stable and have assessed the effect of the breaking
changes on the community.  During that time we will still be doing `npm@2`
releases, with `npm@2` tagged as `latest` and `next`.  We'll _also_ be
publishing new releases of `npm@3` as `npm@v3.x-next` and `npm@v3.x-latest`
alongside those versions until we're ready to switch everyone over to
`npm@3`.  We need your help to find and fix its remaining bugs.  It's a
significant rewrite, so we are _sure_ there still significant bugs
remaining.  So do us a solid and deploy it in non-critical CI environments
and for day-to-day use, but maybe don't use it for production maintenance or
frontline continuous deployment just yet.

#### ONLY ALSO DEV

Hey we've got a SUPER cool new feature for you all, thanks to the fantastic
work of [@davglass](https://github.com/davglass) and
[@bengl](https://github.com/bengl) we have `--only=prod`,
`--only=dev`, `--also=prod` and `--also=dev` options. These apply in
various ways to: `npm install`, `npm ls`, `npm outdated` and `npm update`.

So for instance:

```
npm install --only=dev
```

Only installs dev dependencies. By contrast:

```
npm install --only=prod
```

Will only install prod dependencies and is very similar to `--production`
but differs in that it doesn't set the environment variables that
`--production` does.

The related new flag, `--also` is most useful with things like:

```
npm shrinkwrap --also=dev
```

As shrinkwraps don't include dev deps by default.  This replaces passing in
`--dev` in that scenario.

And that leads into the fact that this deprecates `--dev` as its semantics
across commands were inconsistent and confusing.

* [`3ab1eea`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/3ab1eea)
  [#9024](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9024)
  Add support for `--only`, `--also` and deprecate `--dev`
  ([@bengl](https://github.com/bengl))

#### DON'T TOUCH! THAT'S NOT YOUR BIN

* [`b31812e`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/b31812e)
  [#8996](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/8996)
  When removing a module that has bin files, if one that we're going to
  remove is a symlink to a DIFFERENT module, leave it alone. This only happens
  when you have two modules that try to provide the same bin.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### THERE'S AN END IN SIGHT

* [`d2178a9`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/d2178a9)
  [#9223](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9223)
  Close a bunch of infinite loops that could show up with symlink cycles in your dependencies.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### OOPS DIDN'T MEAN TO FIX THAT

Well, not _just_ yet.  This was scheduled for next week, but it snuck into
2.x this week.

* [`139dd92`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/139dd92)
  [#8716](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/8716)
  `npm init` will now only pick up the modules you install, not everything
  else that got flattened with them.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

### v3.2.2 (2015-08-08):

Lot's of lovely bug fixes for `npm@3`.  I'm also suuuuper excited that I
think we have a handle on stack explosions that effect a small portion of
our users.  We also have some tantalizing clues as to where some low hanging
fruit may be for performance issues.

And of course, in addition to the `npm@3` specific bug fixes, there are some
great one's coming in from `npm@2`!  [@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23)
put together that release this week– check out its
[release notes](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.13.4) for the deets.

#### AS ALWAYS STILL BETA

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**.  Just like the airline safety announcements,
we're not taking this plane off till we finish telling you: `npm@3` will
remain in beta until we're confident that it's stable and have assessed the
effect of the breaking changes on the community.  During that time we will
still be doing `npm@2` releases, with `npm@2` tagged as `latest` and `next`.
We'll _also_ be publishing new releases of `npm@3` as `npm@v3.x-next` and
`npm@v3.x-latest` alongside those versions until we're ready to switch
everyone over to `npm@3`.  We need your help to find and fix its remaining
bugs.  It's a significant rewrite, so we are _sure_ there still significant
bugs remaining.  So do us a solid and deploy it in non-critical CI
environments and for day-to-day use, but maybe don't use it for production
maintenance or frontline continuous deployment just yet.

#### AN EXTRA QUIET RELEASE

A bunch of stuff got deferred for various reasons, which just means more
branches to land next week!

Don't forget to check out [Kat's 2.x release](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.13.4) for other quiet goodies.

#### AS ALWAYS STILL BETA

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**.  Yes, we're still reminding you of this.  No,
you can't be excused.  `npm@3` will remain in beta until we're confident
that it's stable and have assessed the effect of the breaking changes on the
community.  During that time we will still be doing `npm@2` releases, with
`npm@2` tagged as `latest` and `next`.  We'll _also_ be publishing new
releases of `npm@3` as `npm@v3.x-next` and `npm@v3.x-latest` alongside those
versions until we're ready to switch everyone over to `npm@3`.  We need your
help to find and fix its remaining bugs.  It's a significant rewrite, so we
are _sure_ there still significant bugs remaining.  So do us a solid and

### v3.2.0 (2015-07-24):

#### MORE CONFIG, BETTER WINDOWS AND A BUG FIX

This is a smallish release with a new config option and some bug fixes.  And
lots of module updates.

#### BETA BETAS ON

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**.  Yes, we're still reminding you of this.  No,
you can't be excused.  `npm@3` will remain in beta until we're confident
that it's stable and have assessed the effect of the breaking changes on the

#### AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF SUBDEP VERSIONS

#### MERGED FORWARD

* As usual, we've ported all the `npm@2` goodies in this week's
  [v2.13.3](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.13.3)
  release.

### v3.1.3 (2015-07-17):

Rebecca: So Kat, I hear this week's other release uses a dialog between us to
explain what changed?

Kat: Well, you could say that…

Rebecca: I would! This week I fixed more `npm@3` bugs!

Kat: That sounds familiar.

Rebecca: Eheheheh, well, before we look at those, a word from our sponsor…

#### BETA IS AS BETA DOES

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**.  Yes, we're still reminding you of this.  No,
you can't be excused.  `npm@3` will remain in beta until we're confident
that it's stable and have assessed the effect of the breaking changes on the
community.  During that time we will still be doing `npm@2` releases, with
`npm@2` tagged as `latest` and `next`.  We'll _also_ be publishing new
releases of `npm@3` as `npm@v3.x-next` and `npm@v3.x-latest` alongside those
versions until we're ready to switch everyone over to `npm@3`.  We need your
help to find and fix its remaining bugs.  It's a significant rewrite, so we
are _sure_ there still significant bugs remaining.  So do us a solid and
deploy it in non-critical CI environments and for day-to-day use, but maybe
don't use it for production maintenance or frontline continuous deployment
just yet.

Rebecca: Ok, enough of the dialoguing, that's Kat's schtick.  But do remember
kids, betas hide in dark hallways waiting to break your stuff, stuff like…

#### SO MANY LINKS YOU COULD MAKE A CHAIN

* [`6d69ec9`](https://github.com/npm/npm/6d69ec9)
  [#8967](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8967)
  Removing a module linked into your globals would result in having
  all of its subdeps removed. Since the npm release process does
  exactly this, it burned me -every- -single- -week-. =D
  While we're here, we also removed extraneous warns that used to
  spill out when you'd remove a symlink.

* [`fdb360f`](https://github.com/npm/npm/fdb360f)

  Linking scoped modules was failing outright, but this fixes that
  and updates our tests so we don't do it again.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### WE'LL TRY NOT TO CRACK YOUR WINDOWS

* [`9fafb18`](https://github.com/npm/npm/9fafb18)
  [#8701](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8701)
  `npm@3` introduced permissions checks that run before it actually tries to
  do something. This saves you from having an install fail half way
  through. We did this using the shiny new `fs.access` function available
  in `node 0.12` and `io.js`, with fallback options for older nodes. Unfortunately
  the way we implemented the fallback caused racey problems for Windows systems.
  This fixes that by ensuring we only ever run any one check on a directory once.
  BUT it turns out there are bugs in `fs.access` on Windows. So this ALSO just disables
  the use of `fs.access` on Windows entirely until that settles out.

### v3.1.2

#### SO VERY BETA RELEASE

So, `v3.1.1` managed to actually break installing local modules.  And then
immediately after I drove to an island for the weekend. 😁  So let's get
this fixed outside the usual release train!

Fortunately it didn't break installing _global_ modules and so you could
swap it out for another version at least.

#### DISCLAIMER MEANS WHAT IT SAYS

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**.  Yes, we're still reminding you of this.  No,
you can't be excused.  `npm@3` will remain in beta until we're confident
that it's stable and have assessed the effect of the breaking changes on the
community.  During that time we will still be doing `npm@2` releases, with
`npm@2` tagged as `latest` and `next`.  We'll _also_ be publishing new

versions until we're ready to switch everyone over to `npm@3`.  We need your
help to find and fix its remaining bugs.  It's a significant rewrite, so we
are _sure_ there still significant bugs remaining.  So do us a solid and
deploy it in non-critical CI environments and for day-to-day use, but maybe

### v3.1.0 (2015-07-02):

This has been a brief week of bug fixes, plus some fun stuff merged forward
from this weeks 2.x release. See the
[2.13.0 release notes](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.13.0)

`npm@3` bug reports! Thank you and keep up the great work!

#### NEW PLACE, SAME CODE

Remember how last week we said `npm@3` would go to `3.0-next` and latest
tags? Yeaaah, no, please use `npm@v3.x-next` and `npm@v3.x-latest` going forward.

I dunno why we said "suuure, we'll never do a feature release till we're out
of beta" when we're still forward porting `npm@2.x` features. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

If you do accidentally use the old tag names, I'll be maintaining them
for a few releases, but they won't be around forever.

changelog, immediately following this message.

### v3.0.0 (2015-06-25):

Wow, it's finally here! This has been a long time coming. We are all
delighted and proud to be getting this out into the world, and are looking
forward to working with the npm user community to get it production-ready
as quickly as possible.

`npm@3` constitutes a nearly complete rewrite of npm's installer to be
easier to maintain, and to bring a bunch of valuable new features and
design improvements to you all.

[@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23) and
[@isaacs](https://github.com/isaacs) have been
[talking about the changes](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/91303926460/npm-cli-roadmap-a-periodic-update)
in this release for well over a year, and it's been the primary focus of
[@iarna](https://github.com/iarna) since she joined the team.

Given that this is a near-total rewrite, all changes listed here are
[@iarna](https://github.com/iarna)'s work unless otherwise specified.

#### NO, REALLY, READ THIS PARAGRAPH. IT'S THE IMPORTANT ONE.

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**. `npm@3` will remain in beta until we're
confident that it's stable and have assessed the effect of the breaking
changes on the community. During that time we will still be doing `npm@2`
releases, with `npm@2` tagged as `latest` and `next`. We'll _also_ be
publishing new releases of `npm@3` as `npm@3.0-next` and `npm@3.0-latest`
alongside those versions until we're ready to switch everyone over to
`npm@3`. We need your help to find and fix its remaining bugs. It's a
significant rewrite, so we are _sure_ there still significant bugs
remaining. So do us a solid and deploy it in non-critical CI environments
and for day-to-day use, but maybe don't use it for production maintenance
or frontline continuous deployment just yet.

#### BREAKING CHANGES

##### `peerDependencies`

`grunt`, `gulp`, and `broccoli` plugin maintainers take note! You will be
affected by this change!

* [#6930](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6930)
  ([#6565](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6565))
  `peerDependencies` no longer cause _anything_ to be implicitly installed.
  Instead, npm will now warn if a packages `peerDependencies` are missing,
  but it's up to the consumer of the module (i.e. you) to ensure the peers
  get installed / are included in `package.json` as direct `dependencies`
  or `devDependencies` of your package.
* [#3803](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3803)
  npm also no longer checks `peerDependencies` until after it has fully
  resolved the tree.

This shifts the responsibility for fulfilling peer dependencies from library
/ framework / plugin maintainers to application authors, and is intended to
get users out of the dependency hell caused by conflicting `peerDependency`
constraints. npm's job is to keep you _out_ of dependency hell, not put you
in it.

##### `engineStrict`

* [#6931](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6931) The rarely-used
  `package.json` option `engineStrict` has been deprecated for several
  months, producing warnings when it was used. Starting with `npm@3`, the
  value of the field is ignored, and engine violations will only produce
  warnings. If you, as a user, want strict `engines` field enforcement,
  just run `npm config set engine-strict true`.

As with the peer dependencies change, this is about shifting control from
module authors to application authors. It turns out `engineStrict` was very
difficult to understand even harder to use correctly, and more often than
not just made modules using it difficult to deploy.

##### `npm view`

* [`77f1aec`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/77f1aec) With `npm view` (aka
  `npm info`), always return arrays for versions, maintainers, etc. Previously
  npm would return a plain value if there was only one, and multiple values if
  there were more. ([@KenanY](https://github.com/KenanY))

#### KNOWN BUGS

Again, this is a _**BETA RELEASE**_, so not everything is working just yet.
Here are the issues that we already know about. If you run into something
that isn't on this list,
[let us know](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/new)!

* [#8575](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8575)
  Circular deps will never be removed by the prune-on-uninstall code.
* [#8588](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8588)
  Local deps where the dep name and the name in the package.json differ
  don't result in an error.
* [#8637](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8637)
  Modules can install themselves as direct dependencies. `npm@2` declined to
  do this.
* [#8660](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8660)
  Dependencies of failed optional dependencies aren't rolled back when the
  optional dependency is, and then are reported as extraneous thereafter.

#### NEW FEATURES

##### The multi-stage installer!

* [#5919](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5919)
  Previously the installer had a set of steps it executed for each package
  and it would immediately start executing them as soon as it decided to
  act on a package.

  But now it executes each of those steps at the same time for all
  packages, waiting for all of one stage to complete before moving on. This
  eliminates many race conditions and makes the code easier to reason
  about.

This fixes, for instance:

* [#6926](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6926)
  ([#5001](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5001),
  [#6170](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6170))
  `install` and `postinstall` lifecycle scripts now only execute `after`
  all the module with the script's dependencies are installed.

##### Install: it looks different!

You'll now get a tree much like the one produced by `npm ls` that
highlights in orange the packages that were installed. Similarly, any
removed packages will have their names prefixed by a `-`.

Also, `npm outdated` used to include the name of the module in the
`Location` field:

```
Package                Current  Wanted  Latest  Location
deep-equal             MISSING   1.0.0   1.0.0  deep-equal
glob                     4.5.3   4.5.3  5.0.10  rimraf > glob
```

Now it shows the module that required it as the final point in the
`Location` field:

```
Package                Current  Wanted  Latest  Location
deep-equal             MISSING   1.0.0   1.0.0  npm

```

Previously the `Location` field was telling you where the module was on
disk. Now it tells you what requires the module. When more than one thing
requires the module you'll see it listed once for each thing requiring it.

##### Install: it works different!

* [#6928](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6928)
  ([#2931](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2931)
  [#2950](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2950))
  `npm install` when you have an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` will ensure you have
  the modules specified in it are installed in exactly the shape specified
  no matter what you had when you started.
* [#6913](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6913)
  ([#1341](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/1341)
  [#3124](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3124)
  [#4956](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4956)
  [#6349](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6349)
  [#5465](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5465))
  `npm install` when some of your dependencies are missing sub-dependencies
  will result in those sub-dependencies being installed. That is, `npm
  install` now knows how to fix broken installs, most of the time.
* [#5465](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5465)
  If you directly `npm install` a module that's already a subdep of
  something else and your new version is incompatible, it will now install
  the previous version nested in the things that need it.
* [`a2b50cf`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/a2b50cf)
  [#5693](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5693)
  When installing a new module, if it's mentioned in your
  `npm-shrinkwrap.json` or your `package.json` use the version specifier
  from there if you didn't specify one yourself.

##### Flat, flat, flat!

Your dependencies will now be installed *maximally flat*.  Insofar as is
possible, all of your dependencies, and their dependencies, and THEIR
dependencies will be installed in your project's `node_modules` folder with no
nesting.  You'll only see modules nested underneath one another when two (or
more) modules have conflicting dependencies.

* [#3697](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3697)
  This will hopefully eliminate most cases where Windows users ended up
  with paths that were too long for Explorer and other standard tools to
  deal with.
* [#6912](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6912)
  ([#4761](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4761)
  [#4037](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4037))
  This also means that your installs will be deduped from the start.
* [#5827](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5827)
  This deduping even extends to git deps.
* [#6936](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6936)
  ([#5698](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5698))
  Various commands are dedupe aware now.

This has some implications for the behavior of other commands:

* `npm uninstall` removes any dependencies of the module that you specified
  that aren't required by any other module. Previously, it would only
  remove those that happened to be installed under it, resulting in left
  over cruft if you'd ever deduped.
* `npm ls` now shows you your dependency tree organized around what
  requires what, rather than where those modules are on disk.
* [#6937](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6937)
  `npm dedupe` now flattens the tree in addition to deduping.

And bundling of dependencies when packing or publishing changes too:

* [#2442](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2442)
  bundledDependencies no longer requires that you specify deduped sub deps.
  npm can now see that a dependency is required by something bundled and
  automatically include it. To put that another way, bundledDependencies
  should ONLY include things that you included in dependencies,
  optionalDependencies or devDependencies.
* [#5437](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5437)
  When bundling a dependency that's both a `devDependency` and the child of
  a regular `dependency`, npm bundles the child dependency.

As a demonstration of our confidence in our own work, npm's own
dependencies are now flattened, deduped, and bundled in the `npm@3` style.
This means that `npm@3` can't be packed or published by `npm@2`, which is
something to be aware of if you're hacking on npm.

##### Shrinkwraps: they are a-changin'!

First of all, they should be idempotent now
([#5779](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5779)). No more differences
because the first time you install (without `npm-shrinkwrap.json`) and the
second time (with `npm-shrinkwrap.json`).

* [#6781](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6781)
  Second, if you save your changes to `package.json` and you have
  `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, then it will be updated as well. This applies to
  all of the commands that update your tree:
  * `npm install --save`
  * `npm update --save`
  * `npm dedupe --save` ([#6410](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6410))
  * `npm uninstall --save`
* [#4944](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4944)
  ([#5161](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5161)
  [#5448](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5448))
  Third, because `node_modules` folders are now deduped and flat,
  shrinkwrap has to also be smart enough to handle this.

And finally, enjoy this shrinkwrap bug fix:

* [#3675](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3675)
  When shrinkwrapping a dependency that's both a `devDependency` and the
  child of a regular `dependency`, npm now correctly includes the child.

##### The Age of Progress (Bars)!

* [#6911](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6911)
  ([#1257](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/1257)
  [#5340](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5340)
  [#6420](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6420))
  The spinner is gone (yay? boo? will you miss it?), and in its place npm
  has _progress bars_, so you actually have some sense of how long installs
  will take. It's provided in Unicode and non-Unicode variants, and Unicode
  support is automatically detected from your environment.

#### TINY JEWELS

The bottom is where we usually hide the less interesting bits of each
release, but each of these are small but incredibly useful bits of this
release, and very much worth checking out:

* [`9ebe312`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/9ebe312)
  Build system maintainers, rejoice: npm does a better job of cleaning up
  after itself in your temporary folder.
* [#6942](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6942)
  Check for permissions issues prior to actually trying to install
  anything.
* Emit warnings at the end of the installation when possible, so that
  they'll be on your screen when npm stops.
* [#3505](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3505)
  `npm --dry-run`: You can now ask that npm only report what it _would have
  done_ with the new `--dry-run` flag. This can be passed to any of the
  commands that change your `node_modules` folder: `install`, `uninstall`,
  `update` and `dedupe`.
* [`81b46fb`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/81b46fb)
  npm now knows the correct URLs for `npm bugs` and `npm repo` for
  repositories hosted on Bitbucket and GitLab, just like it does for GitHub
  (and GitHub support now extends to projects hosted as gists as well as
  traditional repositories).
* [`5be4008a`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/5be4008a09730cfa3891d9f145e4ec7f2accd144)
  npm has been cleaned up to pass the [`standard`](http://npm.im/standard)
  style checker. Forrest and Rebecca both feel this makes it easier to read
  and understand the code, and should also make it easier for new
  contributors to put merge-ready patches.

#### ZARRO BOOGS

* [`6401643`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/6401643)
  Make sure the global install directory exists before installing to it.
  ([@thefourtheye](https://github.com/thefourtheye))
* [#6158](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6158)
  When we remove modules we do so inside-out running unbuild for each one.
* [`960a765`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/960a765)
  The short usage information for each subcommand has been brought in sync
  with the documentation. ([@smikes](https://github.com/smikes))
