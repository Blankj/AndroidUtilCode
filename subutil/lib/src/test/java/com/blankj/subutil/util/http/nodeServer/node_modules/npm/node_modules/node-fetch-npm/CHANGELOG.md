Changelog
=========


# 2.x release

## v2.0.0

This is a major release. Check [our upgrade guide](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/blob/master/UPGRADE-GUIDE.md) for an overview on some key differences between v1 and v2.

### General changes

- Major: Node.js 0.10.x and 0.12.x support is dropped
- Major: `require('node-fetch/lib/response')` etc. is now unsupported; use `require('node-fetch').Response` or ES6 module imports
- Enhance: start testing on Node.js 4, 6, 7
- Enhance: use Rollup to produce a distributed bundle (less memory overhead and faster startup)
- Enhance: make `Object.prototype.toString()` on Headers, Requests, and Responses return correct class strings
- Other: rewrite in ES2015 using Babel
- Other: use Codecov for code coverage tracking

### HTTP requests

- Major: overwrite user's `Content-Length` if we can be sure our information is correct (per spec)
- Fix: support WHATWG URL objects, created by `whatwg-url` package or `require('url').URL` in Node.js 7+

### Response and Request classes

- Major: `response.text()` no longer attempts to detect encoding, instead always opting for UTF-8 (per spec); use `response.textConverted()` for the v1 behavior
- Major: make `response.json()` throw error instead of returning an empty object on 204 no-content respose (per spec; reverts behavior changed in v1.6.2)
- Major: internal methods are no longer exposed
- Major: throw error when a `GET` or `HEAD` Request is constructed with a non-null body (per spec)
- Enhance: add `response.arrayBuffer()` (also applies to Requests)
- Enhance: add experimental `response.blob()` (also applies to Requests)
- Fix: fix Request and Response with `null` body

### Headers class

- Major: remove `headers.getAll()`; make `get()` return all headers delimited by commas (per spec)
- Enhance: make Headers iterable
- Enhance: make Headers constructor accept an array of tuples
- Enhance: make sure header names and values are valid in HTTP
- Fix: coerce Headers prototype function parameters to strings, where applicable

### Documentation

- Enhance: more comprehensive API docs
- Enhance: add a list of default headers in README


# 1.x release

## v1.6.3

- Enhance: error handling document to explain `FetchError` design
- Fix: support `form-data` 2.x releases (requires `form-data` >= 2.1.0)

## v1.6.2

- Enhance: minor document update
- Fix: response.json() returns empty object on 204 no-content response instead of throwing a syntax error

## v1.6.1

- Fix: if `res.body` is a non-stream non-formdata object, we will call `body.toString` and send it as a string
- Fix: `counter` value is incorrectly set to `follow` value when wrapping Request instance
- Fix: documentation update

## v1.6.0

- Enhance: added `res.buffer()` api for convenience, it returns body as a Node.js buffer
- Enhance: better old server support by handling raw deflate response
- Enhance: skip encoding detection for non-HTML/XML response
- Enhance: minor document update
- Fix: HEAD request doesn't need decompression, as body is empty
- Fix: `req.body` now accepts a Node.js buffer

## v1.5.3

- Fix: handle 204 and 304 responses when body is empty but content-encoding is gzip/deflate
- Fix: allow resolving response and cloned response in any order
- Fix: avoid setting `content-length` when `form-data` body use streams
- Fix: send DELETE request with content-length when body is present
- Fix: allow any url when calling new Request, but still reject non-http(s) url in fetch

## v1.5.2

- Fix: allow node.js core to handle keep-alive connection pool when passing a custom agent

## v1.5.1

- Fix: redirect mode `manual` should work even when there is no redirection or broken redirection

## v1.5.0

- Enhance: rejected promise now use custom `Error` (thx to @pekeler)
- Enhance: `FetchError` contains `err.type` and `err.code`, allows for better error handling (thx to @pekeler)
- Enhance: basic support for redirect mode `manual` and `error`, allows for location header extraction (thx to @jimmywarting for the initial PR)

## v1.4.1

- Fix: wrapping Request instance with FormData body again should preserve the body as-is

## v1.4.0

- Enhance: Request and Response now have `clone` method (thx to @kirill-konshin for the initial PR)
- Enhance: Request and Response now have proper string and buffer body support (thx to @kirill-konshin)
- Enhance: Body constructor has been refactored out (thx to @kirill-konshin)
- Enhance: Headers now has `forEach` method (thx to @tricoder42)
- Enhance: back to 100% code coverage
- Fix: better form-data support (thx to @item4)
- Fix: better character encoding detection under chunked encoding (thx to @dsuket for the initial PR)

## v1.3.3

- Fix: make sure `Content-Length` header is set when body is string for POST/PUT/PATCH requests
- Fix: handle body stream error, for cases such as incorrect `Content-Encoding` header
- Fix: when following certain redirects, use `GET` on subsequent request per Fetch Spec
- Fix: `Request` and `Response` constructors now parse headers input using `Headers`

## v1.3.2

- Enhance: allow auto detect of form-data input (no `FormData` spec on node.js, this is form-data specific feature)

## v1.3.1

- Enhance: allow custom host header to be set (server-side only feature, as it's a forbidden header on client-side)
