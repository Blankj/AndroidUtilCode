.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Search the registry for packages matching the search terms\. \fBnpm search\fP
performs a linear, incremental, lexically\-ordered search through package
metadata for all files in the registry\. If color is enabled, it will further
highlight the matches in the results\.
.P
Additionally, using the \fB\-\-searchopts\fP and \fB\-\-searchexclude\fP options paired with
more search terms will respectively include and exclude further patterns\. The
main difference between \fB\-\-searchopts\fP and the standard search terms is that the
former does not highlight results in the output and can be used for more
fine\-grained filtering\. Additionally, both of these can be added to \fB\|\.npmrc\fP for
default search filtering behavior\.
.P
Search also allows targeting of maintainers in search results, by prefixing
their npm username with \fB=\fP\|\.
.P
If a term starts with \fB/\fP, then it's interpreted as a regular expression and
supports standard JavaScript RegExp syntax\. A trailing \fB/\fP will be ignored in
this case\. (Note that many regular expression characters must be escaped or
quoted in most shells\.)

Search the specified registry for modules\. If you have configured npm to point
to a different default registry, such as your internal private module
repository, \fBnpm search\fP will default to that registry when searching\. Pass a
different registry url such as the default above in order to override this
setting\.
