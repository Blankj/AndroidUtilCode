[`npm-pick-manifest`](https://github.com/zkat/npm-pick-manifest) is a standalone
implementation of [npm](https://npmjs.com)'s semver range resolution algorithm.

### Example

```javascript
const pickManifest = require('npm-pick-manifest')

fetch('https://registry.npmjs.org/npm-pick-manifest').then(res => {
  return res.json()
}).then(packument => {
  return pickManifest(packument, '^1.0.0')
}) // get same manifest as npm would get if you `npm i npm-pick-manifest@^1.0.0`
```

### Features

* Uses npm's exact semver resolution algorithm
* Supports ranges, tags, and versions

### API

#### <a name="pick-manifest"></a> `> pickManifest(packument, selector, [opts]) -> manifest`

Returns the manifest that matches `selector`, or throws an error.

Packuments are anything returned by metadata URLs from the npm registry. That
is, they're objects with the following shape (only fields used by
`npm-pick-manifest` included):

```javascript
{
  name: 'some-package',
  'dist-tags': {
    foo: '1.0.1'
  },
  versions: {
    '1.0.0': { version: '1.0.0' },
    '1.0.1': { version: '1.0.1' },
    '1.0.2': { version: '1.0.2' },
    '2.0.0': { version: '2.0.0' }
  }
}
```

The algorithm will follow npm's algorithm for semver resolution, and only `tag`,
`range`, and `version` selectors are supported.

The function will throw `ETARGET` if there was no matching manifest, and
`ENOVERSIONS` if the packument object has no valid versions in `versions`.

If `opts.defaultTag` is provided, it will be used instead of `latest`. That is,
if that tag matches the selector, it will be used, even if a higher available
version matches the range.

If `opts.enjoyBy` is provided, it should be something that can be passed to `new
Date(x)`, such as a `Date` object or a timestamp string. It will be used to
filter the selected versions such that only versions less than or equal to
`enjoyBy` are considered.

If `opts.includeDeprecated` passed in as true, deprecated versions will be
selected. By default, deprecated versions other than `defaultTag` are ignored.
